#### What I am Doing Now

Yay! I was finally able to get a new 'satisfactory' all-in-one svg footer for my site. Something in the minima theme for the blogging portion of this site was changed such that my individual svg icons in the footer no longer showed up in 1 line across the bottom of any new page or post. I was able to put the links on the icon code pieces in the 'all-in-one' footer svg image I created. Therefore, I am staying with blogging here on this site, ie not a sub-site. I will finish restoring the site to what it was before I got stumped up by the change in the jekyll build process. 

That is the frustrating thing about coding and why I have to limit myself. I thought I had reached the point that I would just have to dump coding and just stick to an app or 2 I paid for (but bargains), which allow for less of my own coding and do not change as often and not without being informed and without instruction, ie less control of how my site looks and functions. I prayed about it and was willing to dump, but for now it looks like I can stick with my ration of coding for which I feel will help me study and share Bible knowledge. Programming can be a real rabbit hole for time, especially with my need to stick to low-budget online tools.

This world remains and is progressively more unstable. We are ever closer to the time of the end of the current world as we know it, and we must be prepared for new system under Jehovah God's rulership through Jesus Christ. I have always tried to keep myself prepared for the potential need for me to bring in more income, but I think I will be able to do that if need be. I see pursuit of a more active relationship with God as being of higher priority. Along with that means doing according to Matthew 24:14: "And this good news of the Kingdom will be preached in all the inhabited earth for a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come." I have been focusing more on web skills than nursing and I will continue with web skills education, using it creatively with Bible knowledge and sharing it.
