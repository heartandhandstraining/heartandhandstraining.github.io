I recently took some time to address the COVID-19 issue. Today I started a little page about my Mom, who I just lost on April 02, 2020.

This is such an amazing and inspirational link, [Faith: Silly or Significant](https://greensock.com/faith/). I stumbled upon man's story of his journey from Atheism to Christianity in trying to make a decision as to whether to use Snapsvg or Greensock for assistance in advancing my new SVG animation skills.

An important note for myself: I recently fixed an issue with the routing of my post links on github when they functioned perfectly on my local machine. It seems I accidently deleted some front matter and permalinks or reverted git too far back in my site building. However, I am glad to have been faced with the challenge of fixing the issue because it helped me understand the path variables and how they are used on github. My site is not configured exactly as before because I learned how to make use of ```baseurl```. This page instantly shed enlightment on ```baseurl```:[Clearing Up Confusion Around baseurl -- Again](https://byparker.com/blog/2014/clearing-up-confusion-around-baseurl/)

Prior to the above, I was working on (and will continue to improve upon) displaying [SVG images](/My-1st-SVG-Animations) along with their animation on this jekyll github-pages site. The following is an animated svg image.
