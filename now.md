I will be adding regularly to 'Mom is Free' post or awhile as part of remembering my Mom who passed away April 02,2020.

I will be working on a jekyll-github website similar to this one, using more svg images.

<!-- {::nomarkdown}
<svg width="200" height=200>
    <circle id="circle-fade" cx="150" cy="100" r="10" fill="blue"/>
</svg>
{:/} -->
