At the moment I am working on animating an svg scripture graphic I made, and I would like to make many more of these, hopefully getting faster at it, too!

Working on a jekyll-github website similar to this one with an animated svg image in the header: [Don Easy Website](https://www.doneasy1.com) is on the back-burner until needed.

I will be adding regularly to [Mom is Free](/Mom-is-Free/) for awhile as part of remembering my Mom who passed away April 02, 2020.
