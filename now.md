the number of talents to each according to his own ability 5 to 1/2 to another and 1/2 1/3 so I often wonder really how much money was he leaving for them to invest interesting lie in Jesus day we're told that a person would have to work for 19 to 20 years to accumulate the equivalent of just one time so imagine the master left eight talents with his trusted slave it was a huge Fortune well when

of challenges in fact Jesus himself a certain circumstances that could have deterred him from his preaching and teaching work but he Prevail and An experience great joy difficult circumstances also affected first century Christians in fact if you look at Acts chapter 13 with me we can learn about some challenges that Colin Barnabas face while preaching in Antioch that's Acts chapter 13 and we're going to read versus 50 51 and 52 bear attacks 13 we read what do Jews inside of the prominent women who were God sharing and the principal men of the city and they stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and threw them outside their boundaries they did not like hearing the truth and did you notice they didn't kindly ask Paul and Barnabas to leave but they threw them out of the city here's the question how did Paul and Barnabas respond to such a challenge noticed please first 51 and 52 e Reed Show De Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet against them and went to Iconium but notice first 52 and the disciples that is all the brothers who were still there in Antioch continue to Joy and holy spirit despite such intense opposition why how could it be well it was because those disciples could see beyond the moment of opposition they remain confident that Jehovah and His holy spirit was backing there on that same occasion if you'll look at first 38 many Gentiles in Antioch who were rightly disposed for everlasting life became believers what sure that must have brought the disciples well Brothers we too can be filled with joy despite challenges that we may face and I Ministry can you think of some challenges that you faced or others have faced well let's look at true first one frequently work territory some congregations as we know have more territory than they can cover While others may be covering their territory quite often maybe even weekly of course right now we have a unique situation is most of us are unable to engage and house-to-house or public Ministry due to the global pandemic so the question how are we meeting these challenges and maintaining our joy simply put just like the brothers in Antioch we have confidence that Jehovah's holy spirit is supporting us Jehovah's holy spirit is helping us to adapt and learn how to systematically go from house to house note is this not in person but by telephone and letter-writing in fact many of our brothers and sisters are being filled with joy as they fulfill their ministry under these circumstances consider this experience of one sister we've been very diligent writing letters but she began to wonder if her efforts were having any results what did she do she specifically pray to Jehovah asking if he could provide her notice this some acknowledgement in response to her letters well on that very same day she received this note from a man she had written to he said I received your letter a couple of months ago I appreciate the work you're doing I just wanted to acknowledge you and say keep up the good work well you can imagine how much joy that brought to our dear sister.
Well here's the Second Challenge in our territory or indifferent why are people well one reason is probably the deplorable record of false religion many no longer feel that religion has a place in how do we meet such a challenge well we need to talk to people about matters that affect unemployment he'll pore Healthcare the environment the threat of War think about the effective training that we're receiving now from the faithful and discreet slave they helping us to focus on starting conversations as supposed to presentations or years ago we would actually give sermons or scripture sermons and through a midweek meeting we've been encouraged to do several things and starting conversations one to be friendly and just speak to people just start a conversation 3 be alert for an opportunity to introduce the good news but do not be in a hurry allow the conversation to develop naturally why do they say that well if we force matters the person may become uneasy and stop conversing about here is an interesting point that was brought out in the midweek meeting we don't have to be disappointed if the conversation ends before we can give a witness that's very interesting why do we say that well remember what happened to Paul and Barnabas they were thrown out of town so the conclusion is we should not allow challenges in our territory to Rob us of joy in our ministry other other challenges that we face that are more personal it may have sent their Ministry how can we Rejoice despite these personal challenges well let's look at 3 here's one disaster and financial adversities we all know that it seems when we turn on the news every day there's a new disaster a flood of fire a tornado the hurricane and earthquake and now are worldwide Brotherhood is experiencing a devastating disaster all at the same time of global pendant these disasters whether natural or man-made can impact us in many ways they can leave us without a home without a job and it could affect our spiritual routine so despite this challenge how can we find joy well we can see Joe Hovis loving care of us through the comfort and relief efforts of our Brotherhood many of us have seen and experienced this loving care and have been help to maintain Joy by remaining active in the preacher War you see many of our brothers are facing economic problems like they've never chased before this can create a lot of pressure can consume a lot of time it can cause us to become overwhelmed it can interfere with our share in the ministry so what can we do what some have done when unemployed in addition to diligently looking for practical ways to care for their family is use this opportunity to increase and their preaching activity what they've done they take advantage of the daily virtual meetings for field service and then they engage in phone with the same letter writing return visits and bible studies for. Of time they have found that this Ministry is a source of great joy and really helps them to maintain balance so rather than being overwhelmed by despair over economic hardships they know that Jehovah will care for them as promised that Matthew 6 and verse 33 do not allow disasters and financial adversities to rob you of joy in your ministry second area is health problems serious health problems can discourage us and could hinder participation in the ministry the challenge notice the promise made it Psalm 145 verses 10 through 14 Merit describes Jehovah's loyal ones who Praise Him and proclaim the glory of his kingship well that well describes our brothers and sisters who continue to praise Jehovah although limited by help but notice what verse 14 says about them Jehovah support all four falling and raises up all who are bow down yes Jehovah will support his loyal servants who may be bald Low by health problems impact Brothers many of our brothers and sisters suffering from serious health problems experienced great joy in finding ways to tell others about the kingdom this one sister in her nightie lives in a nursing home she explains this I start each day asking Jehovah to give me the desire and the power to give a witness then I asked him to create an opportunity for me to talk well as you can imagine she's well-known in the nursing home as one nurse sent to her with tears in her eyes you have really given me hope and others in the nursing home assist this sister to connect to congregation meetings in the JW Broadcasting programs what a joy she experiences health problems the conclusion not allow health problems to rob you of joy in your ministry here is a third negative feelings and personality conflicts well do the human imperfection and reasoning we all seem to have Moments When we struggle with negative and words feelings about ourselves and really this usually occurs when we failed to see ourselves the way to hold p**** sauce the discouragement that follows really sap our strength map of Asia sap our joy what can we do well one of the most powerful ways to combat this is highlighted in Psalm 55 in verse 22 burden on Jehovah and he will sustain you never will he allow the righteous one to fall yes we can talk to Jehovah about our we can talk to him repeat brings to mind the chorus of one of the original song title on him you may remember it says trust in Jehovah don't give in Just Let It Go rolling on him you're not alone you can pray he hears your words he feels your pain don't keep that burden in Rowlett on him Soul by looking to Jehovah's word and relying on his powerful Holy Spirit we can fight these negative feelings and keep busy and I Ministry Bell at times these negative feelings are not about ourselves it's about someone else this creates a personality conflict and really brothers we You should never allow problems with others to hinder our ministry and service to Jehovah God we could fall into a trap the Trap of not wanting to join our brothers in the ministry because of that one person who has offended us oh really gets on our nerves what can we do well the scriptures Dell has plainly Proverbs 12 and 20 reminds us that those who promote peace have joy so we can work hard to prevent envy and resentment from taking root in our hearts Colossians 3 12 through 14 tells us to close ourselves with love the perfect Bond of Union we apply this Council we will continue to put up with one another while being grateful that others are putting up with us and we forgive one another freely the conclusion do not allow negative feelings or personality conflicts to rob you of joy in your ministry well we've considered a number of challenges that could diminish our joy and hinder our men if you notice we've also been reminded how Jehovah values are faithful service despite the challenges that week is it worth all the effort please notice the answer found in Romans chapter verses 3 through 5 are wearied not only that but let us rejoice wall and tribulations since we know that tribulation produces endurance endurance internet approved condition be approved condition intern hope and the Hope does not lead to disappointment because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which was given to us yes our endurance through tribulations leads to an approved condition which is our cause for great a review question how can we maintain our joy in the ministry despite challenges the answer acts 13:50 through 52 Romans 5:3 through 5 if we're diligent in the preaching were like the diligence slaves with their masters talents we will maintain our joy think about it Brothers Grand future that lies ahead for all Faithful Servants of Jehovah soon those with the Earthly hope we'll have the prospect of living together in the new world forever painful challenges will be gone imagine the joy you will have them knowing that your whole soul efforts in the ministry help those who are with you now in God's new world we will enter into the joy of our master the conclusion alone nothing to deprive you of Godly Joy or stop you from preaching now Jehovah and Jesus our masters will reward you with joy now and you will be filled with lasting joy for all eternity - Brother Rains---------------------------------------

DO NOT LET YOUR HEARTS BECOME WEIGHED DOWN

Have you had moments when your hearts felt weighed down You Are Not Alone our Brotherhood is indeed growing together that's so for good reason Jehovah God wants us to focus on the quality of joy joy is what helped Jesus when he was full of anxiety to endure the hardest day of his life will focus on how we you and me all of us Jehovah's dedicated servants can maintain our joy so that our hearts don't become way and when they do become way down because of living in this imperfect system it is hoped that this discussion will help us to minimize or shrink these moments to a manageable degree so that we can continue 21 and see what basis Jesus gives us to remain joyful Luke 21 we're going to read versus 29 through 31 I wish that he told them an illustration tree and all the other trees when they are budding you see it for yourself and know that now the summer is near likewise also to you when you see these things happening what was Jesus speaking about he was speaking about the very things he discussed in Luke chapter 21 the things that would Mark the last days the end of this wicked system of things when you see these things I noticed what Jesus is next Kingdom of God is near kingdom of God that very expression is music to our ears we love that expression the kingdom of God a superhuman world government is near and is ready to take over Earth's Affairs and we are ready for the kingdom of God we're ready for the real life to live in a paradise peaceful Earth we are ready to live without crime in sickness and death in pestilent we are ready to see our loved ones again and hold them tight and our arms and we see growing evidence all around at the kingdom of God is near that's very expression brings us joy why does it bring us joy because Joy is an emotion that is excited by the expectation of good any motion that is excited by the expectation of good what Greater Joy can we have than to know that the kingdom of God is near and what your hovel will do by means of his rulership in fact our hearts they beat in eager anticipation of his Royal government and what it will accomplish and the fact that we know this we have this information and we can explain it to others that's so adds to our joy so what is clear clear that Jesus wants us to be joyful now but the question is possible I have this information I have this knowledge of the coming new world to understand the kingdom of God what it will accomplish and still not be joyful yes and that is why Jesus goes on in Luke chapter 21 and he gives us a warning because he wants us to understand that there are things I can interrupt our joy so in chapter 21 and now in verse 34 let's see what Jesus says he says but pay attention to yourself your hearts never become weighed down with overheating and heavy drinking on the anxieties of life and suddenly that they be instantly upon you it's vital for us to understand that first expression of Jesus that our hearts not become weighed down what does that mean we're speaking about our fingertips are and who we are as a person the inner person But especially Does it include our emotions and feelings for Jehovah and the truth Carhartt become way down then our secret service for for Jehovah will feel like a mere formality or routine car worship of Jehovah becomes tedious then the danger is that we can lose our best for the truth and in effect put out the fire of the spirit Jesus warning hear about the heart becoming way down we're not talking about gross sin he is speaking about becoming preoccupied with daily life he knew you realize his followers to get distracted from spiritual priorities and if they did this what impact and doe their feelings for Jehovah and their love of the truth so what do we learn. For the kingdom of God is music to our ears we love it and that will bring us joy because we expect something good and yes it's a warning not to allow our hearts to become way down why because that would impact our love for Jehovah and for the truth so now let's take a more specific look at verse 34 Luke 21 and see what Jesus says next he says not letting our hearts be way down but with ovaries and heavy drinking eating and drinking that's a normal part of life evens King Solomon said we should eat and drink and and enjoy life and enjoy all the good work that we do Jesus turn water into wine we know that but Jesus is not speaking about just eating and drinking notice he said overheating and heavy drinking so his focus is on over indulgence overindulgence now why why would Jesus put boundaries on eating and drinking because he knows the effect it would have on our spirituality Jesus knew what overindulgence would do to our spiritual progress priorities for example let's read Proverbs chapter 23 Proverbs chapter 23 this is an example of what can happen in a spiritual way Proverbs chapter 23 am I going to read verse 20 and 21 do not be among those who drink too much wine among those who Gorge themselves on meat for a drunkard and a glutton will come to poverty and drowsiness will cold one with rags I'll think about that it's Solomon uses how much more aware would Jesus be that it does not take anything extra ordinary for a person to come to spiritual poverty that's what we're speaking about Jesus could recall from his pre human existence that he saw committed food to become unduly important to his lasting harm Bakery Kaufman spree human existence what happened to Aaron's sons Nate Avenue bio perhaps while under the influence of alcohol offered unauthorized fire and were executed is he Jesus knows overindulgence in food and drink make one careless regarding their conduct and privileges towards serving Jehovah God you can make one drowsy until in their response to do the will of Jehovah and to fulfill their responsibilities toward him that's what Jesus was big overindulgence well I'm too tired to study I'm too tired to prepare for the meetings were just using this as an example Jesus knows human nature and he's trying to help us overindulgence can way down the heart with feelings of guilt desire for Spiritual things such excesses could smother good motivation so again it's not simply a matter of avoiding sinful conduct we're speaking about the ordinary things that can take us down spiritually if we become preoccupied with them do illustrate have you taken a picture with a macro-setting. You direct your Focus where you want for example on a flower and what happens to that flower with that macro setting it becomes super crisp and sharp and yet at the same time everything else in the background gets blurred and as good as that camera is can only focus on one thing at a time what would be the same with our spiritual Focus we don't want to allow seemingly ordinary things like eating and drinking to preoccupy us so much that are spiritual priority become blurred in the background why it will affect our heart are figurative heart our feelings and emotions for the truth and that leads to poverty John summary what have we learned up to this point if we keep ordinary things like eating and drinking under control we will experience more joy and that Joy can shrink are anxious moments and help us keep faithful to Jehovah. 
something else Jesus mentioned Luke Jesus packed with meaning...In Luke 24 verse Luke chapter 21 verse 34 that's go back there to Luke 21 and back to verse 34 when I finished with verse 34 every word of Jesus is important every sentence he's trying to help her verse 34 about to be careful our hearts are not lay down with anxieties of life why would he say anxieties of life that simply means the worries of daily life making a living providing for our family and I don't think there's anyone that hasn't experienced an anxious moment about their work at some point and keeping one's job that's a different story right now especially because of the the virus pandemic and it said that many are losing their their jobs in spite of their good work ethic and longtime a record businesses are stabilizing struggling to stabilizing people are being let go their work you are one of these and if you are we are not we are not in any way minimize anxiety that you feel our hearts go out to you we know it is not easy and it's normal to be concerned about how we are going to provide for a family or loved ones and how we're going to make ends meet that's normal but remember we can only focus on one thing at a time and if we focus on these anxieties then our spiritual priorities are going to be blurred that's what Jesus is speaking about and now he goes further if we look at Matthew chapter 6 Jesus even gets more specific so let's do that that's open our Bibles to Matthew chapter 6 Matthew chapter 6 and we're going to read versus 2131 + 32 Jesus says never be any and say what are we to eat what are we to drink what are we to wear why would Jesus say this because he knows this is the normal reaction to us in daily life he doesn't want us to be unduly worried about tomorrow why what's the danger verse 32 all these are the things the nations are eagerly pursuing the nations are illegally pursuing who's the nation's the Nations people the nations are not true Christians people of the Nations do not have a loving caring heavenly father. They are eager to pursue material things Jesus knew that he knew that an attitude like this would damage our relationship with Jehovah God who doesn't want us to be like the nation it's our relationship with Jehovah that is different we have a relationship and that makes a difference in our attitude and our actions imagine the following illustration you enter into a bakery filled with delicious fresh bread the baker offers you a choice you can have all the bread you want one time offer take it all or he says you can work for me if you work for me I promise to give you the bread you want every day for life should you work for him is this just a trick a scam well how you answered with depend on how well you know the baker it's a bakery someone you know to be responsible and honest you see the way he treats his customers his workers there's no hesitation you take the offer you work for him you learn for him plus you the bread you need each day but if you don't know the baker or trust him you say well this is great I'll get as much as I can now while I can you grab armfuls of armfuls of bread in back of the truck it's short-sighted though because you know the bread is going to be bad and you're not going to be able to eat it all anyway but that's the nation's the nation's today. They do not know or trust Jehovah God.Do they have the attitude of letting me get as much as I can as I can load up the truck as much as possible and often they don't even get to enjoy it so trusting Jehovah working alongside learning from him becoming more like in developing a closeness that has its own reward and we will always have the bread we need for each day why should we trust Jehovah Jesus goes on let's read verse 32 The Fray last sentence in verse 32 it's so important he says your heavenly father knows that you need all these things got a beautiful statement Jesus and affect obligated his father to care for those who could spiritual interests first he knows you need all these things Jehovah God loves us Christ Jesus loves eager to use their strength in behalf of us to help us with our needs crisis so fond of the sons of men he laid his Ransom down for you and me why wouldn't they care for our needs but what if the things I want and the things that you hover says I need are different what's in it doesn't really matter first off Jehovah knows our needs better than we do and even more to the point Jesus isn't talking about how to get things is focuses on experiencing Jehovah's love and care for his dedicated service while men can cause us to lose our job they cannot prevent Jehovah God our heavenly father from answering our petition to care for our daily needs the loss of material things will never mean the loss of Jehovah's love and care in fact at times the loss of material advantages can be the Catalyst for personally experiencing Jehovah's Loving Care in a greater way and there's just something special about receiving help that you know came from Jehovah God oh there it is yes we will have anxious moments that's okay but we don't want to be overly anxious when this happens Hearts can be weighed down and our Focus shifts away from spiritual matters and remember how dangerous that is we can only focus on one thing well so far we've talked about how ordinary things like eating and drinking can way our hearts down and we've we become preoccupied with them and we've talked about how to say things like working employment can way our hearts down. If we become overly anxious about them but what about things that we enjoy can they weigh our hearts down definitely let's use an example of something that we all enjoy is music most hardcore evolutionists have a hard time explaining why humans are so drawn to music since it seems to serve no practical benefit to man we don't need it to exist we don't need it to survive and yet we find music everywhere down throughout the ages of human history and every culture there is music well perhaps one reason is so prevalent is because we have what is called a susceptibility to music that is a kenning mediately affect us in a number of ways you can sue this Energizer us reassure us Thrillers mobilizes it can make us happy can make us sad isn't it interesting that music we can even recall childhood song that brings with it the memory of the Moment music has power because it affects our emotion we need to recognize that but now let's contrast music that can lift us up build us up and music that can change our Folk open our Bibles to Exodus chapter 15 Emily use this as an example Exodus chapter 50 this is when the Israelites left Egypt cross the Red Sea what happened verse 20 and Miriam the prophetess Aaron's sister took a tambourine in her hand all the women followed her with tambourine and was dances Miriam sang a response to the men sing to Jehovah for he has become highly exalted the horse and its Rider he has hurled into the sea I'd like you to imagine that scene following the tenth plague the Israelites were told to leave Egypt in haste and they only had time to gather important items such as their kneading trough bones would they would use to prepare bread this boy was for preparing breaded would be an important item make sure you freak don't forget the kneading trough but isn't it interesting Miriam and the women had tambourine the Bible doesn't say exactly why but could it be that they were anticipating Jehovah's victory over the Egyptians what a cause for celebration that would be don't forget your tambourine well whatever the reason the Israelites find themselves safely on the other side of the Red Sea can you picture them now singing and dancing to those tambourines into the night praising Jehovah under the Black Velvet Sky studded with stars The Rising Moon that would have been a night one would never forget well think of the songs that we might sing after we cross our me get what type of songs Victory songs song 148 Jehovah provides Escape song 149 a victory song and that's based on Exodus 15 add Exodus chapter 15 what about song 150 seek God for your deliverance how do you feel whenever we sing 139 see yourself when all is new well that's the way we feel now with such joy and confidence in Jehovah how we feel after Armageddon when those words become a reality memorizing Victory songs now we show our confidence in Jehovah God who will provide escape and effect we are packing our time in anticipation of the celebration music has power it affects our emotions let's use Music properly to build us up however here's the question do you think Satan can use the power of music to to shift our Focus away from Joe let's find out let's go to Exodus chapter 32 let's see what happens here this is someone's after the Israelites praise Jehovah God and song and he ran Exodus chapter 32 we're going to find Moses and Joshua descending from Mount Sinai and they hear music verse Seventeen Joshua began to hear the noise of the people because of their shouting he said to Moses there is a sound of battling the camp but Moses said no no no it's not the it's not the sound of singing over Victory and it is not the sound of wailing over defeat I hear the sound of another kind of think this was unusual another kind of had a Sinister connection and sure enough they came down and what do they see they see the Israelites singing and dancing around up Golden path of golden calf 9 months ago they just witnessed The Parting the Red Sea the 10 plagues upon Egypt and now a golden calf instead of Jehovah what happened they forgot what did they forget they forgot to put their trust in Jehovah God why did they forget to put their trust what shifted their well music was a par their emotions were caught up and the music pulled them away from Jehovah and push them back to Egypt imagine now what music can do for you and me if we're not careful our selection of music and entertainment is that important Satan can use it to pull us away from Jehovah and even push us back to the world if we're not careful so this is the main point when it comes to our choice of music just be discerning be selective and understand the power of music because if not careful that could cause us to lose and change our Focus and we can change our Focus away from spiritual priorities and even hurt Jehovah and hair hurt his heart like the Israelites do how am I doing in this regard well you might need an honest answer perhaps you could ask your mate or ask one of your mature friends if they see a need for you to make any adjustments in music or entertainment and if they do give you some suggestions take it to heart courageously accepted make any needed changes that you need it could save your spiritual life so now the review question how can we avoid becoming way down and losing our joy the answer Luke 21:34 we need to heed Jesus warning and not be distracted by overeating heavy drinking and the anxieties of daily life knowing conclusion would like to read one more scripture and this is in Luke chapter 21 we're going right back to where we started Luke chapter 21 and Jesus concludes this discussion in Luke 21 it which is very very important text again his message is loud and clear verse 36 Jesus says Luke 21:36 keep awake then all the time making supplication so we can escape at Armageddon keep awake but making supplication that's what Jesus wants us to do to pray to think that we can survive spiritually without prayer is delusional and that is why he continues to help us to persistent prayer knowing that we cannot survive spiritually in our own strength what a beautiful way to summarize his advice we can be sure that in the days ahead we will continue to get important warnings about sinful cam. There's no question about that Jehovah God loves us the faithful slave loves us we will get warnings about that But let us never forget that the ordinary things of life and also take us down spiritually because because they have the power to change our Focus Toby determined not to let that happen to you and may all of us be determined and resolve to continue to do our best to follow Jesus counsel and never let our hearts become wave down thank you brother-----------------------

How's your baptism leads to more happiness all of us to draw closer to Jehovah distance to brother Jonathan Smith rivers that never stopped flowing soil that never stops producing Sun but never stops warming clouds that are ever-changing in formation Jehovah God has filled our Earth atmosphere the Sun the Stars he is formed them so that they never stop music why so is Jehovah is the greatest give her and as such we can be very assured of one thing he is also the happiest person in the universe. How can we say that the answer is based on what Jesus said a fundamental truth there is more happiness in giving than in receiving there is no one has more giving than Jehovah now being made in God's image we too are designed are made to be givers we find our greatest happiness and doing so just a joke there is one kind of giving that is more valuable than any other what is that please turn your Bibles with me to Revelation chapter 4 and verse 11 Revelation 4 and verse 11 you are worthy Jehovah Our God to receive the glory and the honor and the power because you created all things and because of your will they came into existence and were created did you notice what we can give to Jehovah in verse 11 he's worthy of us giving him glory honor and Power those three things are related because it requires the last one to accomplish the first to another words to give Jehovah Glory and Honor it means that we have to use a little bit of power or energy or effort of a glory and the honor that he deserves great satisfaction because there is no one more deserving than our creator baptismal candidates are honoring Jehovah by what you have decided to do today today you were making public what you have already done in private you have decided to give Jehovah try everything you've decided to give him your very life how do we know that because before you could come here today A present yourself for baptism you first had to make a dedication to Jehovah what is that station is not just a decision dedication is a solemn promise other words you went to Jehovah in private rare and you told him Jehovah from now on my life is yours if ever there is a conflict between what I want and what you want you will win every time a dedication to Jehovah before this occasion today so following this talk you will be asked have you dedicated your life to Jehovah and if you have done so you can happily say now think Hunter haga must feel when he sees that you have done that you have made the decision to give him your life your time your energy your devotion yes give him the honor and Glory imagine a little child giving a beautiful flower to a parent it isn't much apparent Treasures that little flower. Jehovah Treasures your gift now because of the fact that you have done giving your life to Jehovah we to share that Joy the Jehovah shares and for that reason we welcome you to this occasion to this talk at your baptism will open up opportunities to give in ways that have not yet been possible for you your baptism brings you into a special relationship with Jehovah and dedicated relationship with Jehovah and in that dedication you will be able to accomplish more for Jehovah and you're giving valuable that's a day people give to many causes for many things people give humanitarian assistance maybe they give money their time supporting social causes or other causes but in reality when you give to Jehovah there is no greater or lofty more noble cause you're kidding best cars ever by getting baptized you also become one of Jehovah's Witnesses qualified to represent in your ministry you're qualified to carry his name to testify about him to all humankind so now in addition to that you are going to become part of a global family family of worshippers who are likewise serving Jehovah who likewise want to give him glory and Power usually when people give they start off by giving to their family members they give their family members love and affection and positive thoughts a commendation well guess what at the moment your spiritual family numbers over eight and a half million people your family just got very large your spiritual family and there will be many ways that you can get to your brothers and sisters Chanel the happiness what you feel and giving whether it be to Jehovah directly or mother be to your spiritual family. Happy that's is virtually Unlimited because unlike the world where they met measure giving according to how much a person gets isn't that way with Jehovah Jehovah no matter what you give cheap Treasures he's looking at your heart is looking at your motive the love you have for him I remember some years ago I was walking down the corridor of a large hospital and in this one wing of the hospital with a lot of clocks on the wall and I wanted what they were because they got progressively larger as I went up the wall the bottom of the wall that have people's names with an amount but they had donated to the hospital very bottom $1,000 a little further up 10,000 really near the top of the class got bigger $1000000 that's the world Jehovah Treasures so today we are going to look at two ways in particular that you can give to Jehovah number one your Christian Ministry and number to Virtual Family and remember this as we go through this information Jehovah will never take for granted what you give he will always reward you so what about making disciples Jesus gave us this command in Matthew chapter 28 because it is one of the foremost ways that we can honor and glorify Jehovah by enlarging his spiritual family we help people get on the path of Life today what's involved but we learned honor and Glory require
power. Making disciples requires A little bit of effort on our part what's involved Jesus said go therefore and make disciples so when a person goes except for some energy some effort house to house ministry or write them a letter all if it takes a little bit of effort maybe you'll have to give up a little time that you formally spent on yourself maybe you will see results at first you'll have to keep at it with a little bit more effort but when you preach are sharing with Jehovah's work can we become installer worker as a result you're going to receive Another Blessing Proverbs Chapter 11 verse 24 it says one give generously and ends up with more another with holes what should be given but he comes to Poverty how is that it sounds like almost the opposite of what we would expect you give generously but you end up with more well remember when the Bible makes an expression like this it's not simply talking about money Jehovah God recognizes that there are many ways to give Prime energy African safari what can you get back your face will become stronger because you are talking to others about your hope you become stronger your relationship with Jehovah get stronger so no matter how much you SSS room verse 24 new end up with more sometimes though using does take a little bit of planning a little bit of forethought for example it would be good if a new baptismal candidate you decided that you would like to get out of the ministry at least weekly on a weekly basis while that's going to take a little planning a little scheduling making sure that you have maybe a partner to work with and somewhere to go and something to do in the ministry a good schedule as you get more and more Adept at throwing in the ministry perhaps you'd like to set additional goals for yourself maybe axillary pioneering regular pioneering possibly all the while you're going to keep finding that you're giving more Jehovah remember this to many of us feel somewhat inadequate in the ministry like we never really have quite mastered this but the ministry is like anything else the more you do it the more you work it what you doing the more skillful you become the more skillful you become the more you will enjoy so make it your goal to prove your skill at starting conversations make it your goal to use the teaching tool box that we have been provided as Jehovah's people make it your goal to become a really good witness of Jehovah what if we are somewhat shy by Nature can you still find Joy can you still become skillful in the ministry over the past 50 years or so Brother David Neal a zealously engaged in virtually every aspect of the ministry including Street witnessing phone with the singing business territory letter writing and yet like many of us brother Neil has found a little because he's naturally shy let's talk to present deal today and find out how she has been able to live up to his dedication bow to Jehovah for the Neil tell us a little bit first of all what helps Shermer fully in the ministry will first being laid off from my full-time job at the time I was as mentioned a shy timid nineteen-year-old unbaptized publisher living in central Ohio up to that point my participation of the ministry was minimal and somewhat of a struggle for me There was a Pioneer brother about my age in the congregation when I told him I was now unemployed he encouraged me to join him in the other Pioneers in the ministry since I had time on my hands I took him up on the invitation and as a result I quickly gain more confidence speaking to people not long after this I was baptized and later joined them in the Pioneer work what's in a month after my baptism I had the privilege of conducting a Bible study with to flush the brothers who eventually got baptized service for now suddenly you find yourself witnessing and New York City a challenge right yes I was assigned to a congregation on the west side of Manhattan toll building traffic routes noise Subway's it was all very intimidating but after a while I did what it help me back in Ohio I started working with the local Pioneers from the weekend now they were a group of older sisters who were utterly Fearless in the ministry and they help me learn how to navigate all the unique aspects of field service in a big city in time I no longer felt intimidated and I would also like to mention something else that's been a big help to me since my early days in New York City I've had the practice of saying a silent prayer at every door so I could have the courage to speak to whoever was on the other side wonderful good partners and prayer to your being a happier person over the years I've learned that I'm happiest when I'm out in service with my friends of course in good results is also a source of happiness I remember one couple that are brother and I met while doing speed work the wife immediately showed interest in the Bible and after some discussion she said this was what she had been looking for her whole life I didn't personally study with the family they spoke another language I was happy to hear later that she and all her children eventually came into the truth so the ministry has provided me an opportunity to really help people to have good association with my brothers and sisters and most of all to honor Jehovah there's nothing like it thank you so much for sharing that experience addition to Joy that we get in the ministry as you no doubt it already began experiencing as an unbaptized publisher what about the joy we receive from giving to our spiritual family why not make it a habit of taking notice of how your spiritual family vacation that may need assistance and running errands can you go to the grocery store for them or perhaps give them a ride if they have to get to a doctor's appointment can you show personal in other ways do they need him deal with a benefit from some help cleaning the house for home repairs those efforts are treasured by Jehovah as if you were giving to him supporting others and what you do in fact if you think a little bit about many of our original songs are music videos as you look at your brothers and sisters in those videos there's a good chance that they're smiling because they're giving either giving in the ministry or given to their spiritual family may be showing Hospitality to someone or encouraging someone they're giving their power to honor Jehovah another way that you could do would be to support your Pioneers may be working with them in the ministry so that they can have the association and not be by themselves on a long day or perhaps you can work with others early in the morning or late in the evening when their schedule permits what about new ones in the car geisha you might be able to make them feel at home to make them feel like they're part of your spiritual family in your congregation rosti elderly would appreciate someone just to come and visit and listen to it or they may be those who are sick in the car gation we need assistance as well will someone who is fondly known for doing all of that is with us today her name is Sister Becky panditas would like you to tell us a little bit please what motivates you to support others in the ministry as you have when I was crying at my parents for raising six children on a farm and they always encouraged us to be sells the ministry in to Pioneer but before we were old enough to drive but your sister came by during the week to pick us up later on when I was the only regular Pioneer in the congregation many of the sisters adjusted their schedule so that they could help me in the afternoons and I wasn't working alone so their willingness to help me reach my field service calls motivates me to help standing what about new ones and understand that you have helped others that I may be new to the congregation to make them feel at home when my husband a very large one who made us feel at home they often had us over for dinner worked with us in the ministry so the loss of us that's beautiful preciate that what about the older ones in the congregation we know that sometimes they have very specific needs I understand that you've even had the opportunity to spend the night with them even overnight in the hospital at times for the Bethel schedule that can't be easy uncle Jack in my Aunt Myra off to never left out knowing how that affected them has motivated me to give special attention to the older ones in the congregation how is all of this shoot you help others in the ministry new ones in the congregation older ones how is it given you a special kind of Joy. I don't mean sacrificing some of our time knowing that were helping someone else reach their ministry goals. also when we help you older once we get to know their non Witness children and have had BIble studies with all of them and just recently became unbaptized publishers. Accomplishing these things that make any sacrifice seem negligible. Another Fringe benefit if you will to giving to your brothers and sisters in the congregation and that is a sister Bonitas alluded to it strengthen the bonds of friendship back in the first century sisters were in need the Apostle Paul mentions Macedonian thanks for the privilege of giving makes us feel closer when there's giving in the congregation have you ever felt this way maybe somebody gave you something that you really needed a really appreciate did it make you feel closer to that person or maybe you gave them something but they deeply appreciate it you can bet they felt closer to you giving that just makes us happy but it strengthens the bonds of our Brotherhood giving material things that can be just as that child gives us parents of flower it can be something simple the word of commendation at the right time a meal perhaps a drawing that you yourself have made for someone else beautiful thing about this is that when we give to others in a sense also giving to Jehovah how's that so scripture in Proverbs Converse 70 it says the one showing favor to the lowly is lending to Jehovah and he will repay him for what he does I don't know if you have ever lent something to someone else before but if you have you may have experienced this you didn't get it back or maybe you lent it to them and you got it back a long long time after you thought you might but you notice when we lend to Jehovah it doesn't say he might repay in verse 17 he will repay so there's no one more reliable to learn to in Jehovah and it says it says there in 4:17 or we show favor to the lowly ones who is Jehovah will find a way to repair sometimes it's when you least expect it and sometimes when Jehovah repays you it's exactly what you need at that moment in fact it will be personal because Nobody knows Jehovah knows how to give exactly what we need at exactly the right time for as long as you remain in Jehovah's family of worshippers Jehovah will never stop giving to you you feel happy and logically so because you are giving your life to Jehovah and you're taking a public stand in that regard many many years ago at nearly three thousand years ago someone actually prayed for you for me for all of God's people that we would be generous who was that it was none other than King David when he brought a tremendous treasure for the building of Jehovah's temple in Jerusalem and many people were inspired by trade it's found in Spruce Pine Cove 29 in verses 17 and 18 First Chronicles 29 inverse of 17 + 18 notice what he says here I will know oh my God that you examine the heart and that you take pleasure in integrity and the uprightness of my heart I have voluntarily offered all these things and I am Overjoyed to see your people who are present here make voluntary offerings to you Jehovah the God of Abraham Isaac and Israel our forefathers these inclinations these generous inclinations and thoughts in the hearts of your people and direct their hearts to you did you know that David prayed for us that's right all of Jehovah's people down to the inclination send thoughts in our hearts for the trailer like that doesn't it make you want to live up to that beautiful prayer cultivate the habit of giving the giving spirit and remember if you said how much you can even a silent prayer when you direct your thoughts to Jehovah for a few moments you give a little bit of your power glorify Jehovah play given to Jehovah you will always be happy you will always be rewarded and you will always be satisfied knowing that you are given to the most worthy person in the universe thank you brother Smith
