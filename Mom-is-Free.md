Above is Mom visiting her Dad/Grandpa Wood, an avid Bible enthusiast, in Grand Junction, ~1979. This page was added to periodically over a few months, from Mom’s death on April 01, 2020 to about July 2020, because I wanted to say so much more than at this link: [Sandra Beattie](https://www.hkfuneralhome.com/en-memorium/sandra-d-beattie). I probably did not say all (probably plenty of typos…), but I have said a lot and have decided to move on with memory of Mom and Dad in mind.

As “the dead know nothing at all,” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Mom now has no more pain, no more frustration with being caged up in her own body and dependent on others for most everything, even to change position in bed. Due to her most loving and amazing caregiver, Dad, being freed from his toils of this world sooner, she spent most the past 10 years in a nursing home on top of being unable to walk at all since 1994.

As a CNA, I told myself and my parents that I would not have them going to a nursing home, never! Well, at that time I never imagined a parent of MINE with such a disease so debilitating as MS can be. That was just a few people in the nursing home. Bizarre thing is that a lady a took special care of with MS followed me as a CNA from Grand Junction to Paonia, where my parents helped me take her to the 4th of July fireworks. That fall after I went off to college is when Mom was diagnosed with MS, which was a couple weeks after Mom called me to say that this special lady had passed away due to a complication of MS. So crazy!

She was diagnosed with MS in 1983 and by about 1993, she was wheelchair-bound. For about 20 years, until his passing my Dad provided her top-notch, full-time “nursing” care. She had only what could be dreamed of for personal care, so even landing in one of the best nursing homes I have seen was real hard for her to swallow. And, oh, the guilt trips all of us kids had to experience! It was hard for Mom to imagine that one of us kids could not have cared for her on our own like! Dad was just a tough act to follow in most anything he did, just extraordinary!

Her cats, were always a great comfort. I am hoping her last cat, Rosebud, is allowed to stay at the nursing home, such a loyal friend. She knows no other home.

I loved my Mom dearly, and I want to talk about who my Mom really was in the best years of her adult life, before she was afflicted with this cruel disease. She was a woman of faith, and even though it was difficult and at times her faith maybe seemed dimmer, she never lost it. She did have a dear JW friend in MO, Marsha, those last years of her life visiting her and helping her maintain strength in her faith.

Mom is known by at least 2 of her younger siblings as the only Mom, they know. Because of her parents divorce and until she met Dad, she said she did not want marriage and kids. When she met Dad in her teens, she knew she “had been had.” I remember when Mom got her diamond ring on her tenth wedding anniversary. She explained that she told Dad she did not want a diamond ring until she had been married 10 years. She wanted to make sure her marriage would be a lasting one. She wanted to “earn” her diamond. She most always had that twinkle in her for Dad.

Dad called her his "Little Red Riding Hood," especially when wearing her hooded red sweatshirt, and he often called her his "Annie Oakley" because of her hunting skills, using her bolt action .30 - 06. I believe that is right. Dad always said it like this, "30 ot 6." I never could get into shooting an animal, just one was enough for me. And, it would be hard to shoot one to put it out of its misery, but if I had to I would. Anyway, her gun had the bolt on the side that she would pop the shells/casings in and out of. It was kind of fun to watch her operate it, and Darrel and I went on many wintery hunting (for meat) excursions for deer, elk, and moose with and Dad in our jeeps, esp the cloth-top brown and aqua CJ5s.

I am pretty sure, I was living in a bubble of a more perfect world those first 8 or 9 years of my life while living out at the mines. Even after we moved to Jeffrey City for the next 4 or 5 years, we were still "sheltered." However, it was then along with having had the youngest sibling of the first eight kids of's childhood family, that my parents decided the Bible and God would be a necessary addition to the family guidance. We had's siblings with us a few times up to that point, but this one being with us those last couple of times remains with me pretty distinctly as not being very welcome by myself and with which Dad finally told him he had to go, be on his way. He was definitely not being a good influence on my middle two brothers, and they totally worshiped him. 

 Mom and Dad would spend ours together sitting next to each other on the couch researching the Bible and history books supporting the existence of the Bible and Bible times.  Mom was greatly resistant to the "green" Bible and held tightly to her King James, but eventually she was happily using and cross-referencing with both.  Mom and Dad rebelled against the total materialism of Christmas and that was eliminated from our home by my fifth-grade year. I am very thankful for that and never missed worrying about what was under the tree, not one bit, but that was not the case, for sure, for my brother just younger than me.

We studied the Bible with a very nice Jehovah's Witness couple, who drove 60 miles one-way every time to do so. We also got to the point we would go to Lander once or twice a month for Sunday meeting and/or ministry meetings, and we eventually held Bible meetings in our trailer house (for a the few interested in Jeffrey City) with my dresser as the podium for the Sunday service. 

 Having quite the green thumb, too, she kept the home indoor air healthy with her many house plants. Outdoors, a favorite thing was growing tulips and old-fashioned yellow rosees. It seemed something happened in moving to Paonia, CO, though, she was not as wild about growing things on the property there. She told me she did not like strawberries when she was older, and it seems like maybe she said something like that in Paonia. I remember her saying Washington strawberries that her Grandma had were better (True. I remember picking some and eating them.) We grew strawberries, and she did make strawberry jam, both freezer and regular. Our plants originally came from Grandma Crabtree, so maybe that had something to do with her not liking those strawberries, along with being thrust more into the realm of Dad's family where she did not feel entirely accepted (which definitely was not unfounded). Leaving Wyoming was definitely the end of that more perfect world for sure!

 Mom was focused most on being the best of what she had not had. She also always wanted to be a "baby" or pediatric nurse. She was so proud of getting her GED in Jeffrey City right before my youngest brother, Bert, was born and being told she was "college material" (which DID mean something because not every high-school graduate went to college even when I was of college-age). When she was diagnosed with MS, she felt so robbed of her life, which included this college/career aspiration. I remember her even thinking Grand Junction was almost close enough for her to go to college there when we moved to Paonia. Mom was 35 years old when I graduated and 44 years old when her youngest, Bert, graduated, so there was definitely room in her life for more beyond kids. I many times told her how she truly did the best and most important things in life, that college and career is really not anything that big to be missed. She could not figure out why I got to the point where I would turn down requests to fill nursing shifts beyond my own because I needed mental rejuvenation time for myself. She had no clue how gruelling nursing jobs can be! She just figured people needed me, so why would I not help them anytime they needed help!

Engulfed in and taking great pride in her abilities with babies and children, I remember her singing lullabies in the green rocking chair in our living room to both Sam and Bert. I wanted to be just like her in terms of being fully supportive of her husband and focused on caring for kids. However, I did not at all like a thermometer placed between my butt cheeks, Vicks rubbed into my chest with a cloth diaper around my neck, Neosynephrine drops up my nostrils or in our ears, Sudafed for a cough, or de-wormer medicine. She definitely played many roles as, this nurse or doctor role being her favorite, I think!  Even the family cat got such unwanted attention when she saw the need, and we all seemed to perk up for one reason or another with her treatments. Due to this bit of childhood trauma, though, I never used a rectal thermometer on my girls, nor did I use many mainstream medicines. 

I must give her top credit for knowing when her kids were sick just by looking at them, especially as she got older and with each successive child just that much sharper in her skills. She was good at putting her ear to the chest and back listening to deep breaths for crackling (which she called rattling) or wheezing. She ran humidifiers and vaporizors as needed to loosen phlegm, and we always had a hot water bottle around for those pesky ear aches and ear infections which often went away with just that treatment alone. Honestly, I think she may have gone a little overboard with doctoring of my youngest brother, though. Those early years of MS diagnosis seemed to trigger her personal need to overdo and still be useful in anyway she could. Likely due to lont-time overuse of antibiotics, he ended up with colitis(which was first thought to have been appendicitis, so he ended up with an appendectomy because the docs did not ask the right questions regarding antibiotic history).

Not only did she make all our meals from scratch with whatever was on-hand, she also made all my school clothes until I got in the 5th grade when she came to the conclusion that K-mart had become the easier AND less expensive way to go (which had not always been the case in history). Summer and winter clothes always seemed to be made (or bought) in sets of three different outfits. We generally got 1 pair of dress shoes, a pair of tennis shoes, and a good pair of boots, and maybe a pair of those cheap flip-flops, which we called thongs back then. Not too many kids had all homemade bread let alone, their clothes, too. As I got older, liked to buy boys Levis or boys Wranglers jeans because they cost less and we all usually had boys Levi or Wrangler jackets. She liked to buy (or make) Easter dresses for me, too, and I remember most of them I am sure because I have always loved those spring colors, pastels! made my 8th grade graduation (in Paonia, CO at that time)long dark blue lace-trimmed poke-a-dot dress, too, which I also proudly wore to "meetings" and an assembly in Denver. She made me a knee-length version of that dress in red poke-a-dot material with a strawberries trim which I also proudly wore too meetings and school once-in-awhile.

She said she got all her homemaking and gardening skills from her Grandma Wood, who in addition to caring for her farm family, was also a 4-H leader. Lucky for me,  she enjoyed passing most of that on. However, I had to learn the hard way just how unfortunately hard small family farming can be because of the economic structure of current world. It is sooo enjoyable, real and meaningful work, but it next to impossible to make a living at it nowadays. She wanted nothing to do with "being tied to milk cows" and said she hated sheep, but I think she maybe changed her mind what little she was able to experience of my colorful (both in personallity and outward appearance) primitive breed sheep and all I could create from their wool. 

She kind of blamed "a bit" of her MS symptoms on bucking bales as a young girl and also landing on a rock on her tailbone in the creek they used to play in where she spent much of her childhood in Washington. The real distinct change in her feeling of well-being was the swine flu shot some years before during the '70's.Mom loved being "spoiled" by Dad, which truly was not spoiling by most women's standards, but not having to do those physically harder chores like bucking bales and milking cows made her FEEL spoiled.

I must say thanks to Lauren for helping me getting me back on track here. My girls and I did not end up spending as much time as Lauren with in her years of MS since I was off to college when that hit. After I got married, the closest we lived to and Dad was a good 45 minute drive. That was only for a short time when the girls were tiny and I was also busy working as a nurse in Home-Care, and their Dad was in college. Mom was still fussing over my youngest brother, too, at that time. 
 
 Mom was a true rock, always there for us kids, of utmost importance to her outside Dad and God. And, I always tried to be like her, of course. I feel like I missed the boat with my not playing games with my kids anywhere near as much.  was always in for a game of Monopoly, Clue, Yahtzee, Sorry, Uno, or some other card game and the list goes on. Somehow life gets too busy, especially nowadays, but I sure remember playing a lot of games with . We even played Badminton with some rackets I made with pantyhose and hangers, and we later got real rackets. She was pretty darn good at hitting a birdie around. 

 Due to her being the best listener, a trait of a good psycologist, I know I was able to deal with so much more nonsense of junior high and high school because I had a Mom at home to hear my stories of nonsensical behavior and mistreatment of junior high and high school kids. Most of the time I could get out answers to my own issues through prayer and unloading my stories on her with just a few comments here and there on her part. Whenever she had something to say about my situations, it was very apparent she had similar experiences in her school days. I remember getting a note passed to me that said, "Go ____ blank yourself!" It was kind of funny because I really did not knew what it meant, but I figured it was meant to be hurtful. I showed it to  and asked her what it meant. She said she was not sure but that I should give it to the teacher who was conducting the class the note was passed in. Well, that got the whole class in trouble, a major growly chewing-out by a generally gentle-giant-of-a-teacher-turned-angry-hulk who showed this new side of being able to instill great fear in his subjects! There was no more note passing in that class ever that I can remember! 

My dear Mom was the world's greatest advocate for proper handwashing and cleansing of anything. We learned at home that handwashing, social distancing, covering our coughs and sneezes, etc are the first line of defense against passing germs around. Again, this was great grandma Wood who instilled this in her. It rather boggles my mind what I see going on with this COVID epidemic because the things that prevent the spread of this disease are no different than any other, but now people are finally having to go back to ways that should have never been lost for those times and situations of heavy disease activity. I am boggled by how people are focused primarily upon PPE (not to mention improper use) instead of social distancing and sanitation (handwashing and keeping the hands away from the face and from touching anything unnecessarily).

Now another of her healthful ways was her thing about us being outside if at all possible. In Wyoming for sure, we were outside weather permitting, which was anything above freezing and less than wind that blew dirt in your eyes. If someone was "running in and out of the house" or was lying around the house any length of time, you heard, "You get outside!" She did not appreciate dirt and crap tracked into the house for one thing. She would vaccuum more than once a day if people were tracking stuff in, but she would try to catch that before it happened. The other thing was that she comes from preious eras that knew the importance of outdoor activity for childhood development and health. Yes, I grew up in the day when kids pretty much owned the outdoors and played outside from sun-up to sunset! What has happened in this world seemed to happen pretty fast, this transition from kids living for making their own outdoor fun to needing entertainment via screens of all kinds.

 Mom was quite funny when someone was lying or "telling a story", and she was pretty good at detecting that. I really did not always like her saying this because she was not always right. However, as an adult, being a parent or manager or just listening to anybody's nonsense, there are times that, "I was not born yesterday!" just truly fits! So, yes, I occasionally cannot refrain from using that expression, and I know when I am saying it just exactly where it came from. Another expression my Mom used on on us kids, me for sure anyway, "Get down off your high horse!" Boy, did I dislike that one! But, I have to say that I have come to feel and understand those shoes on a few occasions. Occasionally resorted to saying: "I am NOT your slave!" would get frustrated with us having to pick up or clean up after those in the household. And, again, I did not care for this and tried not to use that phrase often, but at an occasional frustrating moment, it would come out of my mouth. I would think my dislike for those words even as I was saying them, but here are times that I really know the feeling behind them.

I see my Mom in both of my daughters. Audrey has simiar hair in that it was dark brown at birth with new hair coming in blond and turning light brown. She also has those wispy curls around the temples. I think she gets the worry-wart syndrome from my side of the family, as well. Sarah, I have noticed, has some of the same hand expressions, and a more reserved demeanor and like's. Mom would pick at her eyebrows when she was nervous, just pull them all out. When I see those kinds of rather obsessive-compulsive behaviors in my girls, not to mention myself, I think of Mom and Grandpa Wood and I believe they come from that lineage mostly. Routine, things done in a certain order in a certain way was definitely something displayed by Grandpa Wood in his last years, and having disruption in those things really left him an unhappy camper. Now, those OCD-like behaviors are, also, what I think sometimes gets people through rough patches over which they have little or no control. Mom was tough, able to endure a lot difficuly, even if not as gracefully as she or we would have liked. And, I think that trait exists in myself and the girls, too. These things are common to many people and animals, too, but I definitely saw more of this in Mom and her side of the family than in Dad and his side.

As I was walking in the foothills of Boise,ID, yesterday and today, I was reminded of Mom by the Batchelor Button flowers in bloom randomly everywhere. Mom loved all kinds of flowers, but batchelor buttons were a favorite, as were blue flowers. I do not know if she knew about flax, but blue flax (brown seed) has a small, delicate blue flower. To me, it is one of the most beautiful crops out there when it is in full bloom, a field of blue! Dad said that in is studying his Beattie ancestors, who were plantation owners in the Virginia area after migrating here from Scotland, a (however many greats)-grandpa left in his will that a field of flax would be maintained for his wife. I know how awesome that is. Flax is so amazing, not just beautiful. The flaxseed (linseed being the same, just another name), amongst other health benefits, is used to maintain healthy lipid ratios in the blood and clean out the digestive tract. The fibers of the plant, which require a lengthy process to prepare, are spun into fine linens. Linseed is used in making linoleum and the oil is used in caring for wood floors and surfaces. Anyway, the reason I mention flax is that is in blooming randomly everywhere, and is similar at a distance in appearance to batchelor buttons.

That stubborn, independent way that runs strong in both the Wood and Beattie bloods (lots of Scotch, Irish, German in there), also runs in my girls and myself! I am thankful and proud of that independence for the most part. That following the crowd does not come naturally to us is good, but it can make life more stressful if we do not temper it a bit as needed.

Ah! As I was listening to a show about eagles... I remember how Dad, also, called Mom, "Eagle Eye," in her younger days for sure! Of course, this contributed to her being so good at hunting and hitting her targets in one shot. Mom even had eyes in the back of her head because she did not miss a thing! And, she let you know it!

Gee, here is another expression of Mom’s: “It did not just grow legs and walk off!” Of course that meant she knew someone took whatever it was she was referring, too. LOL! I can see the lightning in her eyes when saying it, too. And, of course, that is one I have used, too, just another one that truly fits sometimes, especially when a huge item disappears and you know it was there. Ah, man! I do not blame her for being angry when something disappeared, but that feeling of receiving that glare when you did not do it, but she almost knew (thought) you must have had something to do with it. Ouch!

Ok! Something I have been talking about for several years, a undisputably positive thing Mom taught was that we did not ‘hate’ anything. She did not like hearing that word come out of our mouths. She said you might dislike something, but ‘hate’ was too strong of a word (never mind that Mom messed up once in awhile and used it herself. LOL!) I did, do, and always will stand by that one!

Another thing that Mom and Dad both taught, which I have been dismayed for several years, is seeing the going by the wayside in society of respect for elders. This was so ingrained in me and is a Bible principle that is meant to better our lives. Generally speaking age, which also comes with life experience, means better decision-making, guidance capabilities, and dependability, just to mention a few invaluable attributes. Yes, there are those bad apple/poor example sorts out there in every generation nowadays, so I have a smidgen of understanding for those folks contending this is some sort of inane advice. However, overall, I think the increasing worship of youth and beauty and throwing-away the older and wiser folks is a large reason for our failing society as a whole. Though I may be seeing a heavier dose of this situation where I am living now, this trend has been becoming commonplace everywhere. Respect for elders, amongst other core values, is not being taught in our young children, because people are too busy maybe and/or there is just blatant lack of recognition of the wisdom of such principle. Man is too smart for the basic, principles in the Bible, I guess. We shall see. Time will tell, just as it has over and over in history.

I know Mom would have loved to have everyone pulled together in the end, but she seemed to have accepted that this would not happen as I could tell with our last visit. That was Dad’s goal in his preaching and encouraging “forgiveness” and saying that it would be needed. Forgiveness has to happen, but forgetting is another story. At least she had the love of all her kids in the end. I think that was the biggest thing she was waiting for in order to allow her self to pass on. Mom loved all her kids and I know the feeling. Even if us Moms feel pain of a child not doing right in one way or another, it is next to impossible to lose that love for our children. To be a parent with that kind of love gives the sense of that love that God had for ALL of his children, no matter what pain comes with having them.

Certain foods always remind me of Mom. Fish and shrimp of course! I do know a nurse at the nursing home would find fish on sale for Mom. Mom was good at buddying for those benefits! Often she opted for shrimp instead of having whatever was on the menu for dinner, too. Cream of Wheat or oatmeal with a boiled egg in it was something I only saw Mom do, and since she did it I do it very occasionally, too. Topping all fruits for favorite fruits, at least during late summer, was watermelon with salt on it. She totally loved that. She also liked grapefruit. Those 2 fruits definitely brought a smile to her face and a twinkle to her eye.

Mom drove the little red Toyota Corona, which was part of the family after the Volkswagon bug and before the blue Toyota Corolla station wagon, for the Jeffrey City School District. Darrel and I and 2 or 3 kids who lived out towards the mines road to school that way. We had an orange sign on top that said “SCHOOL BUS.” Now, on occasion, that car was just not the appropriate vehicle for Wyoming weather. Those nasty blizzards demanded the Jeep be utilized to maneuver that drifting snow. I am sure we all have not forgotten the time Mom accidently hit and killed those other kids’ dog. That was such a horrible thud! The dog was always chasing the wheels of our vehicle, especially the jeep. Mom was totally devastated worse than the family who lost the dog. She recovered, but I think it added to her slight fear of driving because it did seem that such little accidents in driving happened more to Mom. Oh, gosh! And, it was Dad who taught Mom to drive. I almost forgot about that! And, it could have been partly so she could do this driving for the school district. As a side note, I also never forgot how those kids who road with us always seems to smell like pickles or something. Funny the things that stick in memory.

Certain foods always remind me of Mom. Fish and shrimp,of course, was pretty standard, but in her younger years she would get anchovies on her pizza on those rare occasions that we went to Shakey’s in Casper. I do know a nurse at the nursing home would find fish on sale for Mom. Mom was good at buddying for those benefits! Often she opt for shrimp instead of having whatever was on the menu for dinner, too. Cream of Wheat with a boiled egg in it was something I only saw Mom do, and since she did it I do it on occasion. LOL! Topping all fruits, I think, at least during the summer was watermelon with salt on it. She totally loved that. She also liked grapefruit. Those 2 fruits definitely brought a smile to her face and a twinkle in her eye.

I was so fortunate to be in on the earlier years of Mom and Dad’s life together! One aspect was that of them studying with and becoming JWs. Mom and Dad together would have both loved how the organization has evolved with technology. They were already primed to live the COVID life. Their site never ceases to amaze me. Having programming and network knowledge gives me true appreciation for the phenomenal extent of worldwide collaborative volunteer efforts in making such a user-friendly site with it’s immense sourcing and cross-referencing! There is practically no excuse for not getting some daily spiritual food because it comes in so many ways with this organization, especially through their website. Their conventions are shorter nowadays, and with the COVID pandemic, the presentations are online, downloadable, and being spread out over a longer time frame such that the congregations can get together to view and discuss in their homes and via Zoom on the weekends. Of course, all their meetings are on Zoom now, and they had already been on to using this tool, also. The [2020 Regional Convention](https://www.jw.org/en/library/videos/#en/categories/2020Convention) has so far what would have been the first days worth of presentations. My favorites for this day (Friday) were both the first video recordings of both the morning and afternoon, but all of it is well worth listening and viewing for greater happiness in life despite the difficult times we may be facing. There will yet be 2 more days worth of this convention over another couple of weekends. These conventions used to be 4 days in a big convention center, all-volunteer, even the acting out skits on stage by congregation members from their respective regions. Anyway, I never cease to be amazed at God's hand with his faithful people on earth!

This is the Mom and Dad that I knew growing up. I took this picture the summer of 1978, not long after moving from Wyoming to the Paonia, CO, acreage. and Dad were avid Bible students, doing it together, as they most always did everything. With that, I have decided I will spend more time doing the same: [HERE]({{ site.baseurl }}/categories/#GOD).
