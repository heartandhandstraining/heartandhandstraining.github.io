 [John 6:44](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/john/6/#v43006044):No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him,l and I will resurrect him on the last day.

 **draws him**: Although the Greek verb for “draw” is used in reference to hauling in a net of fish ([Joh 21:6-11](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/john/21/#v43021006-v430210011)), it does not suggest that God drags people against their will. This verb can also mean “to attract,” and Jesus’ statement may allude to [Jer 31:3](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/jeremiah/31/#v24031003), where Jehovah said to his ancient people: “I have drawn you to me with loyal love.” (The Septuagint uses the same Greek verb here.) [Joh 12:32](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/john/12/#v43012032) shows that in a similar way, Jesus draws men of all sorts to himself. The Scriptures show that Jehovah has given humans free will. Everyone has a choice when it comes to serving Him. ([De 30:19, 20](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/deuteronomy/30/#v5030019-v5030020)) God gently draws to himself those who have a heart that is rightly disposed. ([Ps 11:5](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/11/#v19011005); [Pr 21:2](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/proverbs/21/#v20021002); [Ac 13:48](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/acts/13/#v44013048)) Jehovah does so through the Bible’s message and through his holy spirit. The prophecy from [Isa 54:13](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/isaiah/54/#v23054013), quoted in [Joh 6:45](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/john/6/#v43006045), applies to those who are drawn by the Father.​—Compare [Joh 6:65](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/john/6/#v43006065).
