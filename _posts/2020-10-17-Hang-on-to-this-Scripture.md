title: Hang on to this Scripture!

I never post as much as I have in my head to post, just not enough time. This is a necessary post because I am trying to make myself remember this scripture. From the [2020 Regional Convention](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/conventions/), it left an impression on me, but I have had to go back 3 times to retrieve it because I can't seem to remember the exact place in the Bible, nor where I stashed it! 

This scripture has great significance to me in my own personal journey in growing with Jehovah and in more fully fulfilling his commandment to share/teach what I know to others. There are 2 scriptures that as a teen (or maybe even earlier) put to memory very well as being my first two favorite scriptures: [1John 4:8](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1-john/4/#v62004008) and [James 4:8](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/james/4/#v59004008). This third one encompasses what I need and want to focus on in my sharing/teaching. 

It seemed, in the past, that generally JWs were far too "pushy,"  even more so than other religious folks, in sharing their message. It was not hard for me to understand this over-zealousness, but it is hard without knowledge of God and His purposes to understand folks being so "pushy." People have different personalities. Pushiness definitely was offensive to my Mom, who, also, came from a religious (non-JW background). My Dad was more tolerant and accommodating of such human imperfections, by nature and also due to the fact that there was long history of JWs in his background.

JWs have definitely far tempered this trait down, as a group, anyway. Individual personalities of course still exist, but pushiness is more definitely frowned upon by JWs nowadays. They are trying very hard to teach JWs not to be pushy in their teaching. This Bible counsel enables JWs to be more relaxed and patient about the message reading others: [1Corinthians 3:6](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1-corinthians/3/#v46003006-v46003007) says, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow,so that neither is the one who plants anything nor is the one who waters, but God who makes it grow." Paul is talking about himself and Apollos, being humble Christian servants, or teachers, who are God's fellow workers in cultivating seed (God's Word). 

It is a relief to know that we can relax and and allow ourselves to know when we have done what we can, at least for the moment, in our sharing, and we, then, can pray for God to help it grow, for God to draw them closer. We can put more of the appropriate complexity of water and food (God's word) out for them over time (food for thought, the heart and soul). Hopefully, with prayer and God's workings on their heart, it will be taken in, digested, and yield progressive signs of growth.

There is a compulsion, a feeling of needing to get the message (about God and His purposes as set out in the Bible) across to people, but it requires a lot on the receiving end of the message to contemplate (digest). It is so nice to be able to and feel good about putting any such compulsion that manifests itself in the form of "pushiness" to rest! That, to me, is the worst thing that happens with Christians, especially so many of JWs in my past. Christ's followers only play a role, small but very important parts, in what it takes in helping a person to see what God is and He has to offer. 

One aspect of imitating Jesus modesty relates to being aware of our own limitations, and it is that of being aware of the limitations of others. This was mentioned as part of the last talk (all excellent talks in [this presentation](https://www.jw.org/en/library/videos/#en/mediaitems/VODPgmEvtGilead/pub-jwb_202006_6_VIDEO)) of Spring 2020 Gilead graduation by the Governing Body were so good and related to this discussion of how JWs should be, also. The Gilead graduates were reminded to be like Jesus and not overwhelm, or overload, others on returning home with massive amounts of knowledge, like some sort of showy display. Jesus was very considerate and aware of other's limitations as he says in [John 16:12](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/john/16/#v43016012): "I still have many things to say to you, but you are not able to bear them now."
