title: Hang on to this Scripture!
---

I never post as much as I have in my head to post, just not enough time. This is a necessary post because I am trying to make myself remember this scripture. From the 2020 Regional Convention, it left an impression on me, but I have had to go back 3 times to retrieve it because I can't seem to remember the exact place in the Bible, nor where I stashed it! 

This scripture means so meaning to me in my own personal journey in growing with Jehovah and in more fully fulfilling his commandment to share/teach what I know to others. There are 2 scriptures that as a teen (or maybe even earlier) put to memory very well as being my first two favorite scriptures: 1John 4,8 and James 4:8. This third one encompasses what I need and want to focus on in my sharing/teaching. 

It seemed in the past that JWs were far too "pushy," generally even more so than other religious folks, in sharing their message. It was not hard for me to understand this over-zealousness, but it is hard without knowledge of God and His purposes to understand folks being so "pushy." People have different personalities. Pushiness definitely was offensive to my Mom, while my Dad was more tolerant and accommodating of such human imperfections, by nature and also probably some to do with the fact that there was long history of JWs in his background, probably before they were even called JWs.

JWs have definitely far tempered this trait down, as a group, anyway. Individual personalities of course still exist, but pushiness is more definitely frowned upon by JWs nowadays. They are trying very hard to teach JWs not to be pushy in their teaching. This Bible counsel enables JWs to be more relaxed and patient about the message reading others: 1Corinthians 3:6 says, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept making it grow,so that neither is the one who plants anything nor is the one who waters, but God who makes it grow." Paul is talking about himself and Apollos, being humble Christian servants, or teachers, who are God's fellow workers in cultivating seed (God's Word). 

It is a relief to know that we can relax and and allow ourselves to know when we have done what we can, at least for the moment, in our sharing, and that God we can pray for God to help it grow, for God to draw them closer. We can put more of the appropriate complexity of water and food (God's word) out for them over time (food for thought, the heart and soul). Hopefully, with prayer and God's workings on their heart, it will be taken in, digested, and yield progressive signs of growth.

There is a compulsion, a feeling of needing to get the message (about God and His purposes as set out in the Bible) across to people, but it requires a lot on the receiving end of the message to contemplate (digest). It is so nice to be able to and feel good about putting any such compulsion that manifests itself in the form of "pushiness" to rest! That, to me, is the worst thing that happens with Christians, especially so many of JWs in my past. Christ's followers only play a role, small but very important parts, in what it takes in helping a person to see what God is and He has to offer.
