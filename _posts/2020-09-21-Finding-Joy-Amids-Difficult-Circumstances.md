The Apostle Paul saw it so important that he reminded Christians of Jesus familiar words they're so familiar he didn't want us to underestimate their power so he said We must keep in mind the words of the Lord Jesus when he himself said there is more joy in giving than there is in receiving recording from Acts chapter 20 verse 35 - is the vehicle is an unlimited source of Joy because it's not limited by just what we have to share but it's more so dependent on an attitude that we can share with anyone at any time without cost hospice source of joy the Force bases for our joy is the power of forgiveness freely forgiving others pleases Jehovah and it brings us joy why is that again will call Jesus this time Matthew 6:14 he said for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you think about the joy they have the weight of all our past sins wiped out to the extent that we are willing to forgive others it's a tremendous source of joy you can start right

just discussed sex things that can be an ongoing source of Joy but now we're going to shift our focus a few minutes to how we can help children fight you cuz what can bring them Joy are the same things that we listed that bring joy to me and you who knows our parents are working hard to help our children develop a deep personal relationship with Jehovah and nothing is more important building that relationship then helping them to know and to love God's name that's our next key scripture it highlights the powerful protective benefit of knowing that name let's read Psalms chapter 91 verse 14 Aaron says, speaking of under Inspirations for God he says for God set call she has affection for me I will rescue him I will protect him because he knows my name most fundamental in knowing God's name is to understand is rich meeting it's a source of joy for our children also for us to know that not that he just can but they have and will become whatever he needs to be to accomplish his purpose But more personal humans the crowning Jewel of his physical creation you young people can be used by him to accomplish whatever he sees fit you can be part of the joy of working in harmony with Jehovah can you imagine if you can just bring one person between now and Armageddon to know the joy of Jehovah the way you do that person you can experience that Joy with them and with others

and don't forget they could have despair as well help them to dip into that Limitless resource of kindness giving to others it's a constant source of joy for them I'd like to share with you at this time but thoughts of two younger ones in my congregation in response to a few questions we have IOS 12 year old Angelina she's been baptized about a year what gifts from Jehovah bring you Joy and she promptly said prayer like that since she's already learned to rely on Jehovah so I asked her and Jimmy and what challenges does a 12 year old girl she said I really enjoy associating and working with the young adult sisters who Pioneer in my congregation they seem to be happy they include me though I'm younger and I want to make that my career goal in school my teachers my counselors say that's not a real goal they want to replace my goals with their goals for how to succeed in this world I asked her answer me how do you deal with that and she said I pray a lot and then I got the connection her greatest joy helped her deal with her greatest challenge I did ask her if easier question I just asked her what do you look forward to a new system and she said like most young ones creation the animals but I also asked 10 year old Brendan newly-approved publisher what gift from Jehovah and he said my relationship with him I appreciated ask him what what are your greatest challenges and he said well the kids school want me to play video games some of which are objectionable play video games he said yes I do I said are you good at he said yes I am can you sing me how something that you enjoy doing that you're good at could actually be your greatest challenge but don't be shy when I ask him what help him to resist the challenge to participate in objectionable videos he said this confidently I want to be in the new system with my whole family you know what these two young ones set was inspiring to me because I know that they have joint now and they can experience join the future but now I have a review question for all of you. How can we find joy now the answer is to scripture Psalm 5 verse 11 and 12 that's the one that says we can always rejoicing and then your Psalm 91:14 which emphasized a powerful benefit of knowing God's name so whether young are all we can experience Joy Now by developing a close personal relationship with Jehovah the joy we experience now will help us to cope with our problems in the new system we won't be coping with these trials but the same Joy of Jehovah is going to help us deepen a relationship that can expand throughout all eternity as we come to better know the God of Joy, Jehovah (Brother Ferguson)
