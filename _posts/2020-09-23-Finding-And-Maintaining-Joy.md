Again, I am blown away to the point of tears of humility and joy! I know it sounds crazy, but I never cease to be amazed at the organization of this worldwide organization serving any and all mankind to the very nooks and crannies of the earth, utilizing every tool imaginable as soon as it is available.

Hopefully, this program will be made available to all, same as this past summer's [regional convention](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/conventions/) put on entirely by the Governing Body for the whole wide world, reaching and upbuilding them one way or the other, either TV on online, etc. Wow! Since I do not know when (maybe after the 1st of the year is what I am thinking) any of the videos from this Circuit Assembly may be added online, I want to share and review at the same time here.

So far, we are reviewing [Psalms 32: 1-11](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/32/) and how we can rejoice in Jehovah's forgiveness, protection and instruction. Another scripture of note is [Isaiah 30:15](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/isaiah/30/#v23030015):"...Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust..."

### How Does Jehovah Help Us Rejoice?

Brother Melanfont presented the first talk about maintaining joy using Psalms-32. 

Jehovah's Witnesses are a happy and joyful people. Why? What is it that enables us to remain joyful and happy in the midst of this morally corrupt and God dishonoring world? It's because our happiness and joy are founded on our relationship with Jehovah God. In fact, Jehovah God is the source of our joy and happiness. Psalms 32, written by David, is the theme text of our Circuit Assembly program. It shows that our joy is directly connected to Jehovah. Psalm 32:11 reads, "Rejoice in Jehovah." No one else is mentioned. We focus our attention on Jehovah God, and then it says, "And be joyful you righteous ones. Shout joyfully all you who are upright in heart." This song that David wrote focuses on three loving provisions that Jehovah made and that made David rejoice. The provisions are forgiveness, protection, and instruction. 

Let's start with forgiveness. In Psalm 32:1-5, David says, "Happy is the one whose transgression is pardoned, whose sin is covered. Happy is the man whom Jehovah does not charge with guilt in whose spirit there is no deceit." Then David goes on to reveal how he felt before he confessed his sins to Jehovah in verses 3-5, "When I kept silent my bones wasted away because of my groaning all day long. For day and night, your hand was heavy upon me." Yes, David's conscience was bothering him because he knew that he had violated God's righteous laws. And, he goes on and he says, "My strength evaporated like water in the dry summer heat. Finally, I confessed my sin to you. I did not cover my error. I said: I will confess my transgressions to Jehovah and you pardoned the error of my sins." It was Jehovah's forgiveness that made David happy and Jehovah could see into David's heart. He knew for certainty that David was truly repentant, and that's very comforting because Jehovah can look into our heart and see that we are genuine in our repentance for wrongdoing. 

At times we may feel as David did because of our imperfections and errors, and that can be very discouraging. Jehova knows we want to obey him. We are his dedicated servants, and he knows we're made of dust. Jehovah God is patient with us because he really does care for us, so we don't want to quit. Never give up in observing our great God Jehovah. Receiving Jehovah's forgiveness through faith in Christ Ransom sacrifice is the cause of great joy for us. Jesus died for us that means that he took our place in death. That allows us to pursue a good relationship with Jehovah because our sins have been paid for. Jesus sacrifice is what makes our relationship with Jehovah God possible. So daily meditating, thinking about what Jesus did and how Jehovah provided that sacrifice should touch our hearts, and it deepens our joy in serving and knowing our God. 

The second provision that David mentioned is protection. Psalm 32: 6, 7. As we read, David said, "This is why every loyal one will pray to you." David certainly was a loyal one! "While you may yet be found. Then even the flood waters will not reach him." Then David says, "You Jehovah were a hiding place for me; you will safeguard me from distress. You will surround me with joyful shouts of deliverance." David rejoiced greatly because Jehovah consistently protected him from his enemies, and his enemies could be likened to flood waters surrounding him. David was loyal to Jehovah, and he knew that Jehovah God was on his side. We're living at a remarkable time where we still can approach Jehovah in prayer and beg for his tender mercies, and it's remarkable the protection that we feel as Jehovah's people today. When you think about it, we don't engage in physical combat to protect ourselves. Our protection, our defense against all enemies is our trust in Jehovah God and the assurance we have from him that he will help with whatever trials may come our way. We don't expect miraculous intervention, but of this we can be sure Jehovah will help us to remain faithful regardless of the obstacles that we may face and that is faithful even unto death. Nothing Satan and his agents do can prevent Jehovah from loving us and protecting us. 

We pray for Jehovah's protection. At Isaiah 30:15, we find this most interesting comment. Isaiah 30:15 says, Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust.' what Good Counsel for all of us. Calmness by not exciting ourselves over human schemes and trust by having absolute faith in Jehovah God and his promises. 

See Psalm 32:8,9. Jehovah is speaking to David, "But, I will give you insight and instruct you in the way you should go. I will give you advice with my eye upon you." But, then Jehovah gives a warning that many people don't heed and the warning at verse 9 tells us, "Do not become like a horse or a mule without understanding whose spiritedness must be controlled with a bridle or a halter before it will come near to you. No, we don't want to drift away from Jehovah be stubborn and resist Jehovah's way. We want to willingly submit to all that Jehovah requires of us. Jehovah God gave David instruction and insight because of his word. David had thinking ability. He could see beyond the surface appearance of a situation. So, when faced with temptation in the future, David would be able to anticipate the outcome of his actions, and then he could see what the effect would possibly be and act wisely by applying scriptural counsel. Jehovah's instruction is far superior to anything the world has to offer, and if we follow it, we can overcome any trial or problem. His instructions help us to discern goals that are truly beneficial, that can protect us from wasting our life on pursuing worthless pursuits or things in this world. 

What if we have lost our joy? Jehovah is ready to help us to regain it. He's not expecting perfection. He knows that we are dust, but he knows that we love him, and so he looks to us. He provides his spirit as he looks upon us and blesses us as we endeavor to serve him faithfully. These qualities are truly dear to Jehovah our God: forgiveness, protection, and instruction, all found in Psalms 32. Note how David concludes Psalms 32:10. David wrote, "Many are the Pains of the wicked but the one trusting in Jehovah is surrounded by his loyal love.

Review Question: What are 3 provision from Jehovah that bring us joy? Psalms 32: Jehovah's forgiveness, protection, and instruction.

### Maintaining Joy

The second brother, Brother Ferguson, continued speaking of joy, and I will elaborate more as I review the videos. In maintaining Joy, sources are:

* Maintaining a close relationship with Jehovah.
  - We are in expectation of Jehovah. He cares so much. He is our helper and our shield - [Psalms 33:20](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/33/#v19033020). See also [Psalms 5: 11,12](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/5/#v19005011) 

* Accurate knowledge of God and His purposes
  - This helps us understand how and why things are as they are in the world today and helps us live by fruitages of the spirit.-([Colossians 1_9,10](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/b/r1/lp-e/nwtsty/51/1#study=discover&v=51:1:9-51:1:10)) It also shows and gives us the hope for the future through Him and Jesus. "Indeed, who will harm you if you become zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. However, do not fear what they fear, nor be disturbed. But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect." -[1Peter 3:13-15](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/b/r1/lp-e/nwtsty/60/3#study=discover&v=60:3:15) 

* Joy is a renewable resource. 
  - "...There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving..." - [Acts 20:35](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/acts/20/#v44020035)

* The power of forgiveness 
  - “For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you." - [Matthew 6:14](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/matthew/6/#v40006014)

* Accomplishment in the ministry (proclaiming God's Kingdom)
  - This provides joy in itself and in how Jehovah provides in us being able to do it. Although we are imperfect, we can take heart from Paul’s words: “We have this treasure [of the ministry] in earthen vessels, that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves.” ([2 Corinthians 4:7](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/2-corinthians/4/#v47004007)) Yes, we can render acceptable service​—but only with God-given strength and wisdom.​-[1 Corinthians 1:26-31](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1-corinthians/1/#v46001026)

* Appreciating God's creation
  -  "because what may be known about God is clearly evident among them, for God made it clear to them. For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcuxable. for although they knew God, they did not glority him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their senseless hearts became darkened." - [Romans 1:19-21](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/romans/1/#v45001019)
  - As we do this, we see clearly that God meant the earth to be inhabited.

Help our children by helping them know his name and his creation. [Psalms 91:14](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/91/#v19091014) says He has and will become whatever he needs to be.
