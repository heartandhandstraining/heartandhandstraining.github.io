#### Joy and Skill go Hand in Hand

The better we become at teaching, the more joy we have in it.(Psalms 40:8;
Luke 10:17, 21).

#### Asking Questions

1. Questions stimulate interest, strike up a conversation, or help learn how a person thinks, and direct the conversation in a direction. They can be used stimulate thinking and help people reason things out on their own and show the true motives of opposers. (Matthew 22: 41-45)

Everyone must be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger,for man’s anger does not bring about God’s righteousness.(James 1:19) Wait for patiently for responses to our questions. Listen carefully because we care.

The difficulty in asking questions is in formulating questions that a person has interest and would be willing to put thought and answer. Viewpoint questions invite a person to express thoughts and feelings. 

Improve our skill by following Jesus example in John 11:25,26. Pause, ask, and listen fully. "Do you believe this," though a "yes or no" question, can be very thought provoking.

#### Unleashing the Power of God's Word

For the word of God is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged swordn and pierces even to the dividing of soul* and spirit,* and of joints from the marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.(Hebrews 4:12)
We must read, use, explain the scriptures in our disciple work just as Jesus did. The Bible is God's tool that cuts straight to the heart. For they themselves keep reporting about our first contact with you and how you turned to God from your idols to slave for a living and true God.
