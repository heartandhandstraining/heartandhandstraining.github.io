The better we become at teaching, the more joy we have in it; I must work on this, so I can share God's promises effectively with others. This involves helping people to love God by helping them to know God by studying his Word. The  conversations we have, help us learn how a person thinks so as to direct the conversation in a direction. "The law of God upon my heart must remain in my heart."(Psalm 37:31)"I really delight in the law of God according to the man I am within,"(Romans 7:22; Psalms 40:8; Luke 10:17, 21). I must always pray for myself and others: "Instruct me, O Jehovah, about your way. I will walk in your truth. Unify my heart* to fear your name. I praise you, O Jehovah my God, with all my heart, And I will glorify your name forever,​—PS. 86:11, 12.

#### Asking Questions

1. Questions stimulate interest, strike up ad stimulate thinking and help people reason things out on their own and show the true motives of opposers. (Matthew 22:41-45)

We must follow Jesus example in asking questions and LISTENING to the answer. Everyone must be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger, for man’s anger does not bring about God’s righteousness.(James 1:19) Wait patiently for responses to our questions. Listen carefully because we care.

The difficulty in asking questions is in formulating questions that a person has interest and would be willing to put thought to answer. Viewpoint questions invite a person to express thoughts and feelings. 

Improve our skill by following Jesus example in John 11:25,26. Pause, ask, and listen fully. "Do you believe this," though a "yes or no" question, this one can be very thought provoking.

#### Unleashing the Power of God's Word

The Word of God helps discern the heart, and we can then help the person realize what he really is. It is alive and exerts power and is sharper than any two-edged sword and pierces even to the dividing of soul* and spirit,* and of joints from the marrow, and is able to discern thoughts and intentions of the heart.(Hebrews 4:12)

When we open the Bible and read the scriptures, we are allowing God to do the talking. Paul went to Thessalonica and found people worshiping lifeless idols. Paul wrote in 1Thessalonians 1:9: "For they themselves keep reporting about our first contact with you and how you turned to God from your idols to slave for a living and true God," Further, he rejoiced: "Indeed, that is why we also thank God unceasingly,because when you received God’s word, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but, just as it truthfully is, as the word of God, which is also at work in you believers."(1 Thessalonians 2:13)

We must read, use, explain the scriptures in our disciple work just as Jesus did. Ask questions about scriptures read. If the student "does not get it," reread the key words in the verse. Do not assume all understand words we use, like "the Kingdom." Be patient.

We must be patient. Slow good! It takes a lot of time to develop faith and appreciation for scriptures. Jesus went on to say: “In this way the Kingdom of God is just as when a man casts seeds on the ground." Do we expect those seeds to sprout overnight?" Jesus explains, "On its own the ground bears fruit gradually, first the stalk, then the head, finally the full grain in the head." (Mark 4:26,28). 

##### Examples:  

* Helping a person see the Bible has practical, advice:

What would you say is the key to getting along with people? May I read this a proverb, Proverbs 17:14? "Beginning a fight is like opening a floodgate; Before the quarrel breaks out, take your leave." Do you think this could help us get along with others? Another scripture: Continue putting up with one another and forgiving one another freely even if anyone has a cause for complaint against another. Just as Jehovah freely forgave you, you must also do the same. (Col. 3:13)

* Helping with seeing the Bible as having reliable prophecy: 

In Isaiah 13:19,20 "And Babylon, the most glorious of kingdoms, The beauty and the pride of the Chal·deʹans, Will be like Sodʹom and Go·morʹrah when God overthrew them. She will never be inhabited, Nor will she be a place to reside in throughout all generations." Now, south of Baghdad, Iraq, are the ruins of Babylon where no one lives and no one has for centuries.

* Helping to build faith that there is a Creator: 

Hebrews 3:4 states, "Of course, every house is constructed by someone, but the one who constructed all things is God." If someone told you that the house you live in constructed itself, would you believe it?"

The more we use the Bible, the more effective we will be and we will experience the joy in knowing Jehovah God and his teachings better in sharing of it.

#### Illustrating Key Points

Like Jesus (Matthew 13:34):

* Choose simple illustrations.
* Keep the listeners in mind, something familiar to the student.
* Teach the main point not minor details.

There has to be a good reason to use an illustration, like that the student is not understanding a main point.

[Illustrations That Teach](https://www.jw.org/en/library/videos/reading-teaching-videos/8-illustrations-that-teach-video/)


How to come up with new illustrations:

* Be intently observant (like Jesus)
* Study the publications.
    Watchtower Index
* Listen to skilled teachers.
* Save good illustrations.

Example illustration would be the one about the Good Samaratan.

#### Teaching with Enthusiasm

Stay focused on the positive. Isaiah 51:7: How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of the one bringing good news,The one proclaiming peace,The one bringing good news of something better, The one proclaiming salvation, The one saying to Zion: “Your God has become King!” 

Enthusiasm crosses all boundaries and is contagious. Romans 12:11: Be industrious, not lazy. Be aglow with the spirit. Slave for Jehovah.
Exra 7:10: "Ezʹra had prepared his heart to consult the Law of Jehovah and to practice it, and to teach its regulations and judgments in Israel."

Go over lesson in advance. Meditate on the lesson regarding how the student may benefit the student. 1Thessalonians 1:5: because the good news we preach did not come to you with speech alone but also with power and with holy spirit and with strong conviction, just as you know what sort of men we became among you for your sakes. 

#### Showing Empathy

Our empathy should be like that of Jehovah's, or like that of a mother. "For this is what Jehovah of armies says, who after being glorified* has sent me to the nations that were plundering you:j ‘Whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye." (Zechariah 2:8)
We need the ability to feel another's feelings, thoughts, etc.
(1Thessalonians 2:7,8). 

Be observant. Be a good listener. Provide practical assistance. Show fellow feeling. Consider situations and circumstances of the person. Consider hobbies, interests, backgrounds. Ask good questions WITH time to answers. Be beyond patient. Provide positive feedback, incluing of the person being honest and forthright about anything, even if the answer was not what you were hoping for. Be careful not to pry into matters that are none of our business. Be careful not to show inappropriate interest by becoming overly familiar with the student. Avoid tendency to give superficial advice. It is much better to meditate and due research and then you can give tailored Bible-based information that specifically addresses the student's needs. Explain how to apply any counsel, but DO NOT pressure. The best change always comes from the inside out (from one's own heart). 

Ensure the student has wholesome association. The student will likely lose or choose to lose former associations. Include them in gatherings. Fill the void.

#### Reaching the Heart

We must reach the heart, so the person's own feelings and thoughts move them to be obedient to Jehavoah God.

“Now listen to the illustration of the man who sowed. 19  Where anyone hears the word of the Kingdom but does not get the sense of it, the wicked oner comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart; this is the one sown alongside the road. 20  As for the one sown on rocky ground, this is the one hearing the word and at once accepting it with joy. 21  Yet, he has no root in himself but continues for a time, and after tribulation or persecution has arisen on account of the word, he is at once stumbled. 22  As for the one sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the anxiety of this system of thingsu and the deceptive power of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. 23  As for the one sown upon the fine soil, this is the one hearing the word and getting the sense of it, who really does bear fruit and produces, this one 100 times more, that one 60, the other 30.” -Matthew 13:19-23

"My son, do not forget my teaching, And may your heart observe my commandments." -Proverbs 3:1

It takes time for the student to gain trust. As they begin to have understanding, they will begin wanting to make changes to please Jehovah God.

Isaiah 48:17, 18: (Help a person understand God without talking too much using illustrations and this scripture and others. Avoid yes and no questions.)

"This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser, the Holy One of Israel:
“I, Jehovah, am your God,The One teaching you to benefit yourself, The One guiding you in the way you should walk. 18  If only you would pay attention to my commandments! Then your peace would become just like a river And your righteousness like the waves of the sea.

Ask questions to help a person examine how they feel:
"The thoughts* of a man’s heart are like deep waters,
But the discerning man draws them out." (Proverbs 20:5)

Questions to help draw the inner feelings and thought processes of the student: (Catch: It takes time for a person to develop trust in you, so as to express such feelings.)

* So based on this scripture, what does this mean?
* How do you feel about ___?
* What convinces you that ___?
* How would you react if ___?

As the person's love and understanding grows, he/she will be moved to make changes in thinking to show love for God and faith in his guidance. "For this is what the love of God means, that we observe his commandments;"-1John 5:3.

1 Thessalonians 2:19,20: "For what is our hope or joy or crown of exultation before our Lord Jesus at his presence? Is it not in fact you?u 20  You certainly are our glory and joy."

“God Is Love” “He that does not love has not come to know God, because God is love.”​—1 JOHN 4:8. That has always been my favorite scripture. To me it says it all in a nutshell as to who God is and how we are suppose to be. Knowing Jehovah God and what he intended and plans for us through the Bible and knowing the beauty of his creations would seem to be enough to draw all humans to him. We know, as we see the state of many people in this world, that this is not the case. But, most of us know that it seems there are still many who do or who are capable of loving God. We must find these people, his sheep, and unite (or re-unite them with God and Jesus, so they may find the joy of loving and serving Him now and in his restored earthly paradise.)
