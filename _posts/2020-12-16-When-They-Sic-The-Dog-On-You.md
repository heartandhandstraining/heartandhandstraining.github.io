A new family came to take me to my new home. My new owner also came with a friend and her sheep-dog. At my new home the friend, decided they needed the dog to help get me in line with the group. They feared I am like other dumb breeds that need to be herded. 

It was definitely a scare, and it was hard to pick myself up after dealing with someone and their dog, who does not know me. I did not have that experience but once and hopefully, I can keep that from happening ever again. God knows my heart and he heals it and helps me cope with unintentionally stumblings as this. I was sick for awhile from that stressful event. My new owners gave me lots of TLC to help me get better, and I came to trust my new human family as much as my own sheep family. 

It is hard to be misunderstood but it helps that I have some understanding of those that misunderstand, since it is in part my fault because the initial immpression I give off. As silly as it sounds, my owner says it is typical those of my color, but at least there is that understanding.
