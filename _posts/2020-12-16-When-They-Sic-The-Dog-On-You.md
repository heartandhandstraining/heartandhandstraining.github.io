My name is Chocolate and you see my son, "Zach" and a member of my human family. When I was a teen and before my son came along, my new human family came to take me to this new home. My new family brought my brothers and sisters and I home with a shepherd friend and her sheep-dog assisting with the trip and delivery. At my new home the shepherd friend decided she needed the dog to help get me in line with the group. They feared I am like sheep from other modern breeds that need to be herded. I was totally caught off guard, scared for my life. The dog chased me down the highway.

They captured me and brought me back. It was hard to pick myself back up after dealing with the person and her dog, who simply just did not know me. I had "stress pneumonia" for a short while after that stressful event. My new owners gave me lots of garlic and TLC to help me get better. I came to trust my new human family as much as my own sheep family. 

I did not have that experience but once so far, and hopefully, I will keep that from happening ever again! My primitive sheep family has long had special connection to God, who knows hearts and also heals them, and he helps his sheep help in coping with unintentional adverse trials. 

It is hard to be misunderstood but it helps that I have have some understanding of those that misunderstand me.  My personality is just not the same as those modern breeds of sheep that need to be rounded up and put in place by a dog. As silly as it sounds, my owner says it is, especially, typical of those of my color, but at least they do now have that understanding.
