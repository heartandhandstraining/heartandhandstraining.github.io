On occasion I have to pray for Jehovah to put the bad thoughts out of my head, others I pray for a bit of a boost in my spirits. It works for me. I could not remember the arrogant thoughts that had been in my head upon awakening the other day shortly after prayed for humility to send those thoughts on their way. 

I feel like I do a lot of bouncing in my studies. While doing my usual walk lately my Kindle listening includes of "Jesus-The Way". As lightbulbs go on in my head and I get ideas of what I am going to do, and I miss (or at least think I miss) something, so I usually have to listen to each chapter at least twice. The meditating about what I am listening to is good, just overwhelming sometimes because I seem not to have enough time without coming up with more ideas of what I want to do.

Yesterday, I could not figure out why I was not hearing the Kindle as well as I should have. I readjusted the one earbud I had in my ear and turned up the volume. Shortly thereafter another walker caught me and told me some other web address for some other group that she was inviting me to for a service. I almost gave her jw.org in return, but I refrained. A few steps later I pulled the earbud out of my ear and realized it was in the wrong direction, spewing out the audio of "Jesus-The Way" for all passers by. Oh! My inadvertent witnessing I thought was not too bad of a thing even if it was goofy. Hopefully, I somehow made up for not giving the jw.org site address on that occasion.

Chapter 61-65, especially 62 and 63, but mostly 63, were the chapters to which I listened to today. Chapter 63 had more meaning to me than what was elluded to, and I want to talk about that in my next post, as it is getting late now....
