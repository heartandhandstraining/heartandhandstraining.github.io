title: Sheep Need Protection
category: GOD

I have long felt so heavy-hearted about losing 1 of my very best ewes early in my 13 years of raising them, the same ewe who stood behind with an injured lamb that was not hers until I came to help it. I was new at raising these primitive breed sheep (the kind that would have been in Bible times). I was told about these leader ewes and how these sheep in general needed less oversight than modern day sheep.

This is when I learned that my ram(s) did have to be separated from my ewes for a couple of weeks right after birth. This is the only time I needed to separate a good well-behaved ram from my eyes and lambs. It is these leader ewes that are at added risk around the rams at this time. These ewes do not allow themselves to be shoved aside by a naughty ram. It was at the feed bunk shortly after birthing that my ram blasted her hard on the flank because he wanted her spot at the bunk, and she died not long after (likely bled internally), which meant I, also, lost at least one of her gorgeous newborn twins (If I remember right, another ewe adopted the other).

It makes made me sick and still makes me sick. I did not provide the protection she needed. Ugh! She was smart, strong (inside and out), beautiful, and helpful to her flock and to me. Even the strong are vulnerabilities and dangers!
