Though I am not baptized (yet), I have long been a Jehovah's Witness supporter. I just wanted to make that clear. I definitely appreciate that JWs no longer push so hard for someone to get baptized (actually, less pushy, period), which is the public declaration of their dedication of themselves to Jehovah God. One's repentance and personal dedication to Jehovah God takes (or, at least, it should) place well before public baptism.

Love for Jehovah never left me, nor did He leave me. Forgiveness, repentance and moving ahead in attempts towards being like Jesus and God is mandatory, of course. I repent and constantly have to beg forgiveness for my sins and human errors. And, I desire to make my formal, public to all by baptism and representation of the Jehovah's Witnesses organization.

My parents became JWs in the mid 70's, but they became inactive for a variety of speculative reasons, which I never fully understood nor agreed with. To decide not to associate, I believe one has to already be in a mindset to look for the imperfections in others. 

I went to college, which was not the norm for JW females, especially, of my era, as it was discouraged (at least where I was). I married outside the truth, also. Do I regret? For lack of better expression, it was not easy being a JW at-heart but going about life in an atypical JW mode as it was somewhat lonely (but being an outsider is somewhat my nature and not too bothersome, partly happenstance in childhood family and school life,too) and had its share of heartache, but it also built more inner strength, and being alone is not scary because I know Jehovah is always my friend, and I tried to teach my girls the same. 

Other than maybe some past pushiness and judgementalism, I do not relate to those who having nothing good to say about JWs for whatever reason, and I never have. How we interpret others and our environment has so much to do with what we know as our real experiences. What others intend for us is often not what we see or feel of their intent for us. When I run into folks that have negative to say about JWs, I know that, as with any other issue in life, people believe how they choose, mostly to fit their inner needs and desires, like how the way they want to be, and promote their own ideas with others to fit their world as the see it, need it or want it to be. That is how 2 kids raised in the same family, 2 years difference in age, with parents trying to raise these kids the same, can tell 2 entirely different stories about how growing up in that family was.

Now and again, I run into websites that seem to be mostly, or are, set up to be against Jehovah's Witnesses. I find them to be similar to the negative election campaigning that goes on. Most can be quickly identified as soley purposed to suit one's agenda in affecting the minds of those unable or unwilling to investigate for the truth on their own. 

The persons with troubling stories probably have real problems of some sort and need help. (I did see that on a psyche ward in college.) If the trouble was cause with some sort of experience with a JW or JWs, it definitely is not reflective of the intentions of the Organization as a whole, in particular the Governing Body. That is one thing, I have definitely affirmed in my recent months of being able to listen to the Jehovah's Witnesses Governing Body. This direct guidance was already begun on the [jw.org](https://jw.org/), which includes [JW broadcasting](https://www.jw.org/en/online-help/jw-broadcasting/). 

Horrible things can happen anywhere with anyone to anyone in this world, due to Satan ravenously trying to divert everyone from Jehovah in these "last days". Jehovah's Witness are not immune to this problem, though they try to be. That is why the Jehovah's Witnesses try so hard to find and properly address and correct any issues of wrongdoing amongst members; it is for the protection and representation of all members. It is to provide good witness to Jehovah and Jesus, who they are and their unchanged purpose for all creation. 

Just like my <a href="/Mom-is-Free/#PRAY">parents</a>, I encourage all who want to come to know God to delve into the wealth information on [JW.ORG](https://www.jw.org/). Feel free to [contact]("/contact/") me, also, to discuss Bible-related topics.
