Though I am not baptized (yet), I have long been a Jehovah's Witness supporter. I just wanted to make that clear. I definitely appreciate that JWs no longer push so hard for someone to get baptized (actually, less pushy, period), which is the public declaration of their dedication of themselves to Jehovah God. One's repentance and personal dedication to Jehovah God takes (or, at least, it should) place well before public baptism.

Love for Jehovah never left me, nor did He leave me. I repent and beg forgiveness for my sins and human errors. And, I desire to make this formal, public to all by baptizing as a Jehovah's Witness.

My parents became JWs in the mid 70's, but they became inactive for a variety of speculative reasons, which I never fully understood nor agreed with. To decide not to associate, I believe one has to already be in a mindset to look for the negative in others, no matter who they are. 

I went to college, which was not the norm for JW females, especially, of my era, as it was discouraged (at least where I was). I married outside the truth, also. Do I regret? For lack of better expression, it was not easy being a JW at-heart but going about life in an atypical JW mode as it was somewhat lonely (but being an outsider is somewhat my nature, partly happenstance in childhood family and school life,too) and had its share of heartache, but it also built more inner strength within me. Forgiveness, repentance and moving ahead in attempts towards being like Jesus and God is mandatory, of course. 

Other than some past pushiness and judgementalism, I do not relate to those who having nothing good to say about JWs for whatever reason, and I never have. How we interpret others and our environment has so much to do with what we know as our real experiences. What others intend for us is often not what we see or feel of their intent for us. When I run into folks that have negative to say about JWs, I know that, like with any other issue in life, people believe how they choose, mostly to fit their inner needs and desires, like how the way they want to be and promote their own ideas with others to fit their world as the see it, need it or want it to be. That is how 2 kids raised in the same family, 2 years difference in age, with parents trying to raise these kids the same, can tell 2 entirely different stories about how growing up in that family was.

Now and again, I run into websites that seem to be mostly, or are, set up to be against Jehovah's Witnesses. I find them to be similar to the negative election campaigning that goes on. Most can be quickly identified as soley purposed to suit one's agenda in affecting the minds of those unable or unwilling to investigate on their own. 


The persons with troubling stories probably have real problems of some sort and need help. (I did see that on a psych ward in college.). If the trouble was cause with some sort of experience with a JW or JWs, it definitely is not reflective of the intentions of the Organization as a whole, in particular the governing body. That is one thing, I have definitely affirmed in my recent months of being able to listen to the Jehovah's Witnesses Governing Body. This direct guidance was already begun on the [jw.org](https://jw.org/), which includes [JW broadcasting](https://www.jw.org/en/online-help/jw-broadcasting/). 

Horrible things can happen anywhere with anyone to anyone in this world, due to Satah rampantly affecting everyone and all people in these "last days". Jehovah's Witness are not immune to this problem, though they try to be. That is why the Jehovah's Witnesses try so hard to find and properly address and correct any issues of wrongdoing amongst members; it is for the protection and representation of all members. It is to provide good witness to Jehovah and Jesus and who they are. 

I encourage all who want to know what Jehovah purposes for humankind to delve into the wealth of learning aids via [their websites](https://www.jw.org/). Feel free to [contact]("/contact/") me, also, to discuss Bible-related topics.
