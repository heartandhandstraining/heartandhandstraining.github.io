I have so much more than the following to say about my Mom: [Sandra Beattie](https://www.hkfuneralhome.com/en-memorium/sandra-d-beattie).

My Mom is now resting in peace, no more pain, no more frustration with being caged up in her own body and dependent on others for most everything. She spent most the past 10 years in a nursing home.

As a CNA, I told myself and my parents that I would not have them going to a nursing home, never! Well, at that time I never imagined a parent of mine with such a disease so debilitating as MS can be.

She was diagnosed with MS in 1983 and by about 1993, she was wheelchair-bound. For about 20 years, until his passing my Dad provided her top-notch, full-time "nursing" care. She had only what could be dreamed of for personal care, so landing one of the best nursing homes I have seen was real hard to swallow. And, oh, the guilt trips all of us kids had to experence! It was hard for Mom to imagine that one of us kids just could not have done it on our own for sure!

Her cats, were always a great comfort. I am hoping her last cat, Rosebud, is allowed to stay at the nursing home, such a loyal friend. She knows no other home.

I loved my Mom dearly, and I want to talk about who my Mom really was in the best years of her adult life, before she was afflicted with this cruel disease. She was a woman of faith, and even though it was difficult and at times her faith maybe seemed dimmer, she never lost it. She did have a dear friend, Marsha, those last years of her life visiting her and helping her maintain strength in her faith.

Mom is known by at least 2 of her younger siblings as the only Mom, they knew. Because of her parents divorce and until she met Dad, she said she did not want marriage and kids. When she met Dad in her teens, she knew she "had been had." 

I remember when Mom got her diamond ring on her tenth wedding anniversary. She explained that she told Dad she did not want a diamond ring until she had been married 10 years. She wanted to make sure her marriage would be a lasting one. She wanted to "earn" her diamond. She most always had that twinkle in her for Dad.

Dad called her his "Little Red Riding Hood," especially when wearing her hooded red sweatshirt, and he often called her his "Annie Oakley" because of her hunting skills, using her bolt action .30 - 06. I believe that is right. Dad always said it like this, "30 ot 6." I never could get into shooting an animal, just one was enough for me. And, it would be hard to shoot one to put it out of its misery, but if I had to I would. Anyway, her gun had the bolt on the side that she would pop the shells/casings in and out of. It was kind of fun to watch her operate it, and Darrel and I went on many winter hunting excursions for deer, elk, and moose with Mom and Dad in our jeeps, esp the cloth-top brown and aqua CJ5s.

I am pretty sure, I was living in a bubble of a more perfect world those first 8 or 9 years of my life while living out at the mines. Even after we moved to Jeffrey City for the next 4 or 5 years, we were still "sheltered." However, it was then along with having had
the youngest brother of the first eight kids of Mom's family, my parents decided the Bible and God would be a necessary addition to the family guidance. Though we had Mom's siblings with us several times up to that point, but this one being with us those last couple of times remains with me pretty distinctly as not being very welcome by myself and with which Dad finally told him he had to go and be on his way. He was definitely not being a good influence on my middle two brothers (Darrel and Sam), and they totally worshiped him. Mom and Dad would spend ours together sitting next to each other on the couch researching the Bible and history books supporting the existence of the Bible and Bible times. Mom was greatly resistant to the "green" bible and held tightly to her King James, but eventually she was happily using an cross-referencing with both. Mom and also rather rebelled against the total materialism of Christmas and that was eliminated from our home by my fifth-grade year. I am very thankful for that and never missed worrying about what was under the tree, not one bit, but that was not the case for sure for my brother just younger, Darrel.

We studied the Bible with a very nice Jehovah's Witness couple, who drove 60 miles every time to do so. We also got to the point we would go to Lander once a month or so for Sunday meeting and/or ministry meetings, and we eventually held Bible meetings in our trailer house (for a the few interested in Jeffrey City) with my dresser as the podium for the Sunday service. 

got to go help outside! (more tomorrow.....)
