I must add to the following because my Mom was awesome! [Sandra Beattie](https://www.hkfuneralhome.com/en-memorium/sandra-d-beattie)

My Mom is now resting in peace, no more pain, no more frustration with being caged up in her own body and dependent on others for most everything. She spent most the past 10 years in a nursing home.

As a CNA, I told myself and my parents that I would not have them going to a nursing home, never! Well, at that time I never imagined a parent of mine with such a disease so debilitating as MS can be and was much more so in general in years past.

(more to come....)
