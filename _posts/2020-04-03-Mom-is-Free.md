I have so much more than the following to say about my Mom: [Sandra Beattie](https://www.hkfuneralhome.com/en-memorium/sandra-d-beattie).

My Mom is now resting in peace, no more pain, no more frustration with being caged up in her own body and dependent on others for most everything. She spent most the past 10 years in a nursing home.

As a CNA, I told myself and my parents that I would not have them going to a nursing home, never! Well, at that time I never imagined a parent of mine with such a disease so debilitating as MS can be.

She was diagnosed with MS in 1983 and by about 1993, she was wheelchair-bound. For about 20 years, until his passing my Dad provided top-notch, full-time "nursing" care to my Mom. She had to what only could be dreamed of for personal care, so landing one of the best nursing homes I have seen was real hard to swallow. And, oh, the guilt trips all of us kids had to experence! It was hard for Mom to imagine that one of us kids just could not have done it on our own for sure!

Her cats, were always a great comfort. I am hoping her last cat, Rosebud is allowed to stay at the nursing home, such a loyal friend. She knows no other home.

I loved my Mom dearly, and I want to talk about who my Mom really was in the best years of her adult life, before she was afflicted with this cruel disease.

Mom is known by at least 2 of her younger siblings as the only Mom, they knew. Because of her parents divorce and until she met Dad, she said she did not want marriage and kids. When she met Dad she knew she "had been had." 

I remember when Mom got her diamond ring on her tenth wedding anniversary. She explained that she told Dad she did not want a diamond ring until she had been married 10 years. She wanted to make sure her marriage would be a lasting one. She wanted to "earn" her diamond.

bedtime again! (more tomorrow)
