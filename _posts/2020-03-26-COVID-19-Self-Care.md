We live in an era of primarily "all or nothing" in so many aspects of life. This even applies to modern so-called health-care, and it greatly dismays me.

As I watch people waiting in lines and fighting for and going in and out of their homes with hand-sanitizers, cleaners, and paper products, I kind of chuckle but yet think it is NOT funny. People need much more than that. And, they need to FEEL they have much more power than that to fend off illness!

This representation of health demonstrates the mainstream medical system's inadequacy in its focus on the presence or absence of symptoms of disease as determining one's health, ie just returning and/or maintaining a person to a state of absence of symptoms (Comfort Zone, neutral). The Illness-Wellness Continuum, by Dr. John Travis (1972), has been viewed as a model promoting preventive care (often self care), which strengthens health wellbeing, positioning an individual further away from signs or symptoms of illness. It is also about educating people to be aware of and avoid risk factors, in order to protect against illness, pathology and premature death. Also, ones positive or negative attitude contributes to movement along the contuum. A positive mental outlook leads to a higher level of wellness, while a negative outlook moves one toward more serious illness.

The fact of the matter is that viruses have always existd with man and existed before man. They can lie dormant for years environmental conditions are right for them to awaken. This virus will be more active again here in the US, probably late fall thru early spring, after we think we get on top of it this spring. That is a common story of viruses. Obviously, man's immune system actually has a fairly good capacity to fight back against them or mankind as a whole would have died off centuries ago. We would not have populated the world so heavily, even to the point of damaging the earthly environment.

In all my adult life for sure and even younger years, I have long sensed that much knowledge in health-care has either been forgotten or has been chosed to be forgotten and discounted, that being the simple health promotion practices that has kept man in this overall winning position in his existence on earth over the eons. Why? For some, it probably is a totally innocent choice or maybe it is such for all. I will leave it at that.

The following is a summary list from an audio recording of things learned by the Chinese in patients who did better in fighting the virus. This was a short-lived post on a community website, so short that when I decided I should share it a couple days later, I was too late, ie it was removed from the site. Interesting, just as interesting as many similar incidents in both life-in-general and experiences surrounding the health-care community. When this audio was brought to my attention and I listened, I said and thought, "Oh, yes! I know all that IS beneficial (by my experience)! And, that really is not NEW learning in the prevention of illness, its complications and death, viral illnesses especially."

### General Care for Viral Exposures

1. Social distancing, disposal (if possible) of continamated items, sanitizing of hands and surfaces (where viruses can survive for long periods of time).
2. Warm fluids, sipping every 20 minutes to keep the mucous membranes, inner vessels and spaces moist, so toxins can be easily disspelled from the body (caffeine free teas, lemon and honey, etc)
3. Moving the body, expanding the airways and lungs as much as possible.
4. Lots of fruits and veges.
5. Good sleep.
6. Regular doses of fresh air and sunshine, daily if possible.
7. Positive mental outlook. This includes knowing our bodies are very capable of successfully fighting viruses which then compounds that inner strength.
8. Vitamin C, D, zinc....There are many immune-boosting herbs and spices, including those with anti-bacterial/viral/fungal activity. Do your research.

I will update this if and as I think of other important points or clarification. It sounds almost too simple. These habits should be part of everyday life and taught and promoted in throughout childhood and carried into adulthood to maintain a higher level of wellness. 

The first goal is to send virus particles to the stomach for destruction by stomach acids and prevent any virus from attaching to the throat and then going into and attaching to airways and air spaces. The virus causes very heavy, thick, sticky mucous, which can block the airways and air spaces, preventing air-exhange. This environment then also becomes a good breeding ground for opportunistic bacterial infections on top of the viral infection. Any mucous must be kept moving on out of the lungs as it normally would, just part of cleaning and maintaining the respiratory system. Do not let the virus set up shop in the airways and lungs! This is the potential bad-to-worst case scenario for any such virus. COVID-19 is novel and that is in large part why it reaps greater havoc with ANY of us right now.

As is, the media says approximately 80% of cases of COVID-19 are resolved at home, ie without hospitalization. Improve your individual chances by exercising self-care daily for optimum health. Focus less on media drama.

Note that discomfort/difficulty with breathing, shortness of breath, and poor skin color are signs that medical intervention needs consideration to get the airways cleared and functioning properly.
