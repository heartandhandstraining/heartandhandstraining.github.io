We live in an era of primarily "all or nothing" in so many aspects of life. This even applies to modern so-called health-care, and it greatly dismays me.

As I watch people waiting in lines and fighting for and going in and out of their homes with hand-sanitizers, cleaners, and paper products, I kind of chuckle and shake my head. These things seem to be the primary and essential armor against illness when truly they should be a small  part that does not to instill fear in people if not available.

This representation of health demonstrates the mainstream medical system's inadequacy in its focus on the presence or absence of symptoms of disease as determining one's health, ie just returning and/or maintaining a person to a state of absence of symptoms (Comfort Zone, neutral). The Illness-Wellness Continuum, by Dr. John Travis (1972), has been viewed as a model promoting preventive treatment, which improves wellbeing before an individual presents with signs or symptoms of illness, as well as educating people to be aware of and avoid risk factors, in order to protect against pathology and premature death. Also, ones positive or negative attitude contributes their movement along the contuum. A positive mental outlook leads to better health, while a negative outlook moves one toward illness.

The fact of the matter is that viruses have always existd with man and existed before man. They can lie dormant for years environmental conditions are right for them to awaken. This virus will be more active again here in the US, probably late fall thru early spring, after we think we get on top of it this spring. That is a common story of viruses. Obviously, man's immune system actually has a fairly good capacity to fight back against them or mankind as a whole would have died off centuries ago. We would not have populated the world so heavily, even to the point of damaging the earthly environment.

In all my adult life for sure and even younger years, I have long sensed that much knowledge in health-care has either been forgotten or has been chosed to be forgotten and discounted, that being the simple health promotion practices that has kept man in this overall winning position in his existence on earth over the eons. Why? For some, it probably is a totally innocent choice or maybe it is such for all. I will leave it at that.

The following is a summary list from an audio recording of things learned by the Chinese in successful care of COVID-19 patients. This was a short-lived post on a community website, so short that when I decided I should share it a couple days later, I was too late, ie it was removed from the site. Interesting, just as interesting as many similar incidents in both life-in-general and experiences surrounding the health-care community. When this audio was brought to my attention and I listened, I said and thought, "Oh, yes! I know all that IS all beneficial (by my experience)! And, that really is not NEW learning in the prevention of illness, its complications and death, viral illnesses especially."

### General Care for Viral Exposures

1. Social distancing and sanitizing of hands and surfaces (where viruses can survive for long periods of time).
2. Warm fluids, sipping every 20 minutes to keep the mucous membranes and throat, especially caffeine free teas, lemon and honey, etc
3. Moving the body, expanding the airways and lungs.
4. Lots of fruits and veges.
5. Rest.
6. Exercise, especially in the sunshine and fresh air.
7. Positive mental outlook.
8. Vitamin C, D, zinc....There are many immune-boosting herbs and spices, including those with anti-bacterial/viral/fungal activity. Do your research.

I will update this if and as I think of other important points or clarification. It sounds almost too simple. These habits should be part of everyday life and taught and promoted in throughout childhood and carried into adulthood to maintain a higher level of wellness. 

The idea is to move any virus particles to the stomach where for destruction by stomach acids and prevent any virus from attaching to the throat and then the airways. The virus causes very heavy thick mucous, which can block the airways and fill the lungs, preventing air- exhange. This also creates a great environment for opportunistic bacterial infections on top of the viral infection. Keep the virus from setting up shop in the airways and lungs! This is the potential bad case scenario for any such virus. COVID-19 is novel and that is in large part why it causes such havoc.
