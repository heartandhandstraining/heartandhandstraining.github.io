title: Another Assembly Already
category: GOD

I will be attending another smaller one-day (circuit) assembly on Zoom (again because of COVID) this weekend with the Winrock congregation (Albuquerque, NM, where my daughter is). We just finished the district assembly a couple of weeks ago since it was spread out online over a couple of months because of COVID. I look forward to it, as usual. This one will be lead by folks closer to each congregation's home location. It will be a "first" for circuit assemblies.


This year's regional one (for July 2020) remains free for anyone [here](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/conventions/).
