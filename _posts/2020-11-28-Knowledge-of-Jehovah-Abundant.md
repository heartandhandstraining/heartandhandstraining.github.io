Explore [JW.ORG](https://www.jw.org/). Click on the language tab at the top. Scroll all the way down. Just how many languages is this site available in? Take time to take it alllllll in! Really dive in, but just do not become too overwhelmed. Come back up for air. God does not expect you to absorb it all at once. By know means! I will find a scripture for that point to put in her later. My brain gets overwhelmed, too, and I cannot remember where things are.Sometimes it takes longer to find what I want.At times, I cannot think of enough exact words of the scripture I have in mind, so I have to look another way, by subject one still needs to get as specific as possible if one has a specific scripture in mind.

Next checkout these prophecies: [Daniel 12:4](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/daniel/12/#v27012004) and [Isaiah 11:9](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/isaiah/11/#v23011009). See if you cannot see their fulfillment. Click on the little blue letter and asterisk links for more information and references in the reference column. Maybe you will need to cruise around more on the website if you are not seeing the big picture that I see. Try to find answers to life's questions via the search box. Use the drop-down menus and/or footer links. Click on links of interest. It may take time, more time than you want to spend. I know that also spending time to attend JW meetings also helps in getting to know the site extent and wisdom of the organized structure. The picture just gets bigger and more perfectly clear as to how it is so big that you can only scratch the surface, but keep coming back for just a bit at a time. I have long been familiar with the JWorganization, but it has, in this decade especialy, massively mushroomed and grown brighter in reflecting and sharing God's Word very smoothly and perfectly in an ever more user-friendly fashion, even more perfectly as seems possible through imperfect human beings.

Actually, I was trying to find the scripture(s) I mentioned in the first paragraph, and I stumbled on for today, [Saturday, November 28](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/h/r1/lp-e). Good grief! This happens so much to me. I find things, even by accident, related to what I am trying to find or express at the moment, and this one was posted today, this morning! What?! Wow! When I saw the date, I looked all over for a year, thinking it must be from another year. This kind of thing always happens to me with JW/Bible related stuff, all my life! Coincidences? That is a little hard to believe.
