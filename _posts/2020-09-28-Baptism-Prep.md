I guess I am going to take a break from all "extracurricular" I was working on, like the Babylon Book, to make time to zip through the 2 newer very basic books that are "required" books for baptism on my own. I may be misunderstanding, but I believe it HAS to be done with another publisher, reading each paragraph and answering discussing..... I am hoping if I show my work in answering all the questions that I can at least get away from reading every paragraph, ie I just answer the questions that are in the book with someone else.

Currently, the 2 required books, besides the baptism questions, are: 
* [What Does the Bible Really Teach?](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/bible-teach/)
* [How to Remain in God's Love](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/in-gods-love/)
