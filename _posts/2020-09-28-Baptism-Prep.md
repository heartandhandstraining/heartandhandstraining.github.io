I guess I am going to take a break from all "extracurricular" I was working on, like the Babylon Book, to make time to zip through the 2 newer very basic books that are "required" books for baptism on my own. I may be misunderstanding, but I believe it HAS to be done with another publisher, reading each paragraph and answering discussing..... I am hoping if I show my work in answering all the questions that I can at least get away from reading every paragraph, ie I just answer the questions that are in the book with someone else. 

Yes, it is worth it if I have to go through the process of a meeting with someone every week or whatever someone else's schedule is and go through reading every paragraph of a book that does not have as much new info to me, if I have to do that. It boils down to whether I want to be a part of this group and what they do along with them. As a JW, one goes over and over the information fairly regularly, anyway, amongst themselves and with those new to the information. The information hits us differently at different times in life or other angles are brought out by others, learning and relearning, meditating, the only way it will stick with us forever for endurance.

Currently, the 2 required books, besides the baptism questions, are: 
* [What Does the Bible Really Teach?](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/bible-teach/)
* [How to Remain in God's Love](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/in-gods-love/)
