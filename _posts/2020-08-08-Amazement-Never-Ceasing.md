I have stepped back into accompaniment with Jehovah Witnesses at a time when the "Good News" more clearly reaching all! The current regional convention has been delivered by the governing body, rather than through Witnesses within each region that they are a part! The last district convention I attended live was in Denver, CO, summer of 1978! They are always upbuilding, but this is phenomenal! 

The emphasis regarding baptism is where it should be (same as with Jesus baptism, well into adulthood), on disciple-making work. Being a Jehovah's Witness is as the name states so much about spreading the 'good news,' not baptizing just to save ourselves and going through the motions of attending meetings, so, again, that we are saved because of these works alone. Somehow it seemed that this was a focus of the Organization (or message that came across) which "tripped" up at least some folks a bit, hopefully not a lot, though.... If so, hopefully their hearts are moved to re-vist their congregationsto not be hung up on this small detail with the Witnesses any longer. I know it tripped up my parents a bit along with other, what-I-would-call silly things things (common in the current world) that seem to be the focus or things that may not really being said.

Just to be clear, baptism and attending meetings,of course, helps in building and maintaiing a stronger relationship with God IF that IS the reason for which a person is doing these thing. I love that there seems to be another step within the Organization on the road to being a baptized Jehovah's Witness, that of being officially an "unbaptized publisher." There is a much greater recognition that baptism is a committment one has to be truly ready in their heart and soul. Though, I believe, it was always 
the intent of the upper leadership within the organization, likely the prior religious backgrounds from which indivicual members came influenced their thoughts and interactions within individual congregations.

Dad really would have appreciated ALL of this convention's Bible knowlege, how it's deliverence is being deliverance is so extensive (right into everyone's own home and with capability of intake upon demand, ie at their own convenience, and repeatedly if desired), world-wide collaborative, accurate, in-depth, and by means of ALL currently available technologies!

I am finishing up Saturday afternoon's convention recordings, and over the next 2 weeks, I will partake in Sunday (the remainder). These recordings may be found [HERE](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/conventions/). As things become more and more clear to individuals as truly is happening, how can they deny and not love Jehovah and the Bible truth's that give us what we need to know of Himself, and His plans for the future?!
