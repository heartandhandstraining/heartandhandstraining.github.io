I have stepped back into accompaniment with Jehovah Witnesses at a time when the "Good News" more clearly reaching all! The current regional convention has been delivered by the governing body, rather than through Witnesses within each region that they are a part! The last district convention I attended live was in Denver, CO, summer of 1978! They are always upbuilding, but this is phenomenal! 

Baptism is a greater and public declaration/commitment to disciple-making work. A person should already be long committed before taking that public declaration (similar to marriage).Being a Jehovah's Witness is as the name states about spreading the 'good news,' not baptizing just to save ourselves and going through the motions of attending meetings, so, again, that we are saved because of these works alone. Somehow baptism seemed to be almost forced upon people (had to be done to be saved) which "tripped" up at least some folks a bit, hopefully not a lot of people though.... If so, hopefully their hearts are moved to re-vist their congregationsto not be hung up on this triviality any longer. I know it tripped up my parents a bit along with other, what-I-would-call silly little things and in disregard of the whole picture.

Just to be clear, baptism and attending meetings, of course, helps in building and maintaining an ever stronger relationship with God IF that IS the reason for which a person is doing these things. I love that there seems to be another step within the Organization on the road to being a baptized Jehovah's Witness, that of being officially an "unbaptized publisher." There is a much greater recognition that baptism is a commitment one has to be truly ready in their heart and soul. Though, I believe, it was always the intent of the upper leadership within the organization, likely the prior religious backgrounds from which indivicual members came influenced their thoughts and interactions within individual congregations.

Dad sure would have appreciated ALL of this convention's Bible knowlege, how it's deliverence is covering so much territory (right into everyone's own home and with capability of intake upon demand, ie at their own convenience, and repeatedly if desired), world-wide collaborative, accurate, in-depth, and by means of ALL currently available technologies!

 As things become more and more clear to individuals regarding the Bible prophecies unfolding, how can anyone deny and not love Jehovah and the Bible truth's that give us what we need to know of Himself, and His plans for the future?! I just have to pray that I can have great humility, discernment, empathy, respect, and patience in sharing the information. And, in order to care for others I must care for myself by continually feeding and advancing my knowledge and my relationship with Jehovah and His son, Jesus, through whom we are so blessed to have this opportunity!
