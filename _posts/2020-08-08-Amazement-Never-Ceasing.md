I have stepped back into accompaniment with Jehovah Witnesses at a time when the "Good News" more clearly reaching all! The current regional convention has been delivered by the governing body, rather than through Witnesses within each region that they are a part! The last district convention I attended live was in Denver, CO, summer of 1978! They are always upbuilding, but this is phenomenal! I say that largely because the emphasis is where it should be, on disciple-making work, not baptizing to save ourselves and keeping all active within the congregation, so, again, that we are saved. Somehow it seemed that this is a focus (or message that came across) that "tripped" up many a bit, hopefully not a lot, though. If so, hopefully their hearts are moved to re-vist their congregationsto not be hung up on this small detail with the Witnesses any longer. I know it tripped up my parents a bit along with other, what-I-would-call silly things things (common in the current world) that seem to be the focus or things that may not really being said.

Dad really would have appreciated ALL of this convention's Bible knowlege, how it's deliverence is being deliverance is so extensive (right into everyone's own home and with capability of intake upon demand, ie at their own convenience, and repeatedly if desired), world-wide collaborative, accurate, in-depth, and by means of ALL currently available technologies!

I am finishing up Saturday afternoon's convention recordings, and over the next 2 weeks, I will partake in Sunday (the remainder). These recordings may be found [HERE](https://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/conventions/). As things become more and more clear to individuals as truly is happening, how can they deny and not love Jehovah and the Bible truth's that give us what we need to know of Himself, and His plans for the future?!
