["Walk Humbly and Modestly With Your God"](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/watchtower-study-august-2020/Walk-Humbly-and-Modestly-With-Your-God/) This is a rather favorite topic. It always hits home in some way.

Grrrrh! The biggest point I want to remember to practice is NOT to fall into answering this type of question, "What would you do ____" in regard to a certain situation. Always find Bible references to help them make their own decision. I know I have fallen into that one. I think I tend to try to throw out a lot of "if this" or "if thats," ie not really answer, just throw aspects of the scenario or person that could affect whatever the answer. However, best would be to AUTOMATICALLY NOT answer immediately AND research and direct a person to the Bible. Sometimes I do say I would do this or that if I have a definite opinion for MYSELF being in whatever situation, especially if I have had similar experiences. I think and hope I leave things us to the person, though, but I definitely need to keep this in my head.
