title: What Can the Bible Teach Us?
category: GOD
---

I am just getting started on going through the 2 currently "required" books for baptism in a new way, hopefully, one that also benefits someone besides me. There is always more that could be added, like more supporting scriptures, etc, so feel free to comment. As I finish each chapter,  the links to them will be completed.
