title: What Can the Bible Teach Us?
category: GOD
---

I am just getting started on going through the 2 currently "required" books for baptism in a new way, hopefully, one that also benefits someone besides me. As I go through each chapter,  the links to them will be completed. I will refine the chapter review games as time goes by, and I will share with anyone in my Bible studies.
