Again, I am blown away to the point of tears of humility and joy! I know it sounds crazy, but I never cease to be amazed at the organization of this worldwide organization serving to the nooks and crannies of the earth, utilizing every tool imaginable as soon as it is available.

Hopefully, this program will be made available to all, same as this past summer's regional convention put on entirely by the Governing Body for the whole wide world, reaching and upbuilding them one way or the other, either TV on online, etc. Wow!
