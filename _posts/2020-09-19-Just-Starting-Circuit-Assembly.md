Again, I am blown away to the point of tears of humility and joy! I know it sounds crazy, but I never cease to be amazed at the organization of this worldwide organization serving any and all mankind to the very nooks and crannies of the earth, utilizing every tool imaginable as soon as it is available.

Hopefully, this program will be made available to all, same as this past summer's regional convention put on entirely by the Governing Body for the whole wide world, reaching and upbuilding them one way or the other, either TV on online, etc. Wow!

So far, we are reviewing [Psalms 32: 1-11](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/32/) and how we can rejoice in Jehovah's forgiveness, protection and instruction. Another scripture of note is [Isaiah 30:15](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/isaiah/30/#v23030015):"...Your strength will be in keeping calm and showing trust..."

In maintaining Joy, sources are:

* Maintaining a close relationshhip with Jehovah.
  - We are in expectation of Jehovah. He cares so much. He is our helper and our shield - [Psalms 33:20](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/33/#v19033020). See also [Psalms 5: 11,12](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/5/#v19005011) 

* Accurate knowledge of God and His purposes
  - This helps us understand how and why things are as they are in the world today and helps us live by fruitages of the spirit.-([Colossians 1_9,10](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/b/r1/lp-e/nwtsty/51/1#study=discover&v=51:1:9-51:1:10)) It also shows and gives us the hope for the future through Him and Jesus. "Indeed, who will harm you if you become zealous for what is good? But even if you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, you are happy. However, do not fear what they fear, nor be disturbed. But sanctify the Christ as Lord in your hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone who demands of you a reason for the hope you have, but doing so with a mild temper and deep respect." -[1Peter 3:13-15](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/b/r1/lp-e/nwtsty/60/3#study=discover&v=60:3:15) 

* Joy is a renewable resource. 
  - "...There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving..." - [Acts 20:35](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/acts/20/#v44020035)

* The power of forgiveness 
  - “For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you." - [Matthew 6:14](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/matthew/6/#v40006014)

* Accomplishment in the ministry (proclaiming God's Kingdom)
  - This provides joy in itself and in how Jehovah provides in us being able to do it. Although we are imperfect, we can take heart from Paul’s words: “We have this treasure [of the ministry] in earthen vessels, that the power beyond what is normal may be God’s and not that out of ourselves.” ([2 Corinthians 4:7](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/2-corinthians/4/#v47004007)) Yes, we can render acceptable service​—but only with God-given strength and wisdom.​-[1 Corinthians 1:26-31](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1-corinthians/1/#v46001026)

* Appreciating God's creation
  -  "because what may be known about God is clearly evident among them, for God made it clear to them. For his invisible qualities are clearly seen from the world's creation onward, because they are perceived by the things made, his eternal power and Godship, so that they are inexcuxable. for although they knew God, they did not glority him as God nor did they thank him, but they became empty-headed in their reasonings and their senseless hearts became darkened." - [Romans 1:19-21](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/romans/1/#v45001019)
  - As we do this, we see clearly that God meant the earth to be inhabited.

Help our children by helping them know his name and his creation. [Psalms 91:14](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/psalms/91/#v19091014) says He has and will become whatever he needs to be.
