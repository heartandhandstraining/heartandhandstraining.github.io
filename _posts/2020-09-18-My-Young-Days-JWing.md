The following is Thelma Humphrey and I at JW 1979 District Convention in Denver, CO. I very much enjoyed the convention itself. We went way to the top of a mountain, also, as a fun extracurricular activity. The only thing I did not like about the trip was that the mattress I slept on at a JW friends house had some sort of plastic cover on it that made me puff up when I slept on it (me and my allergies...)

The latter pic was a trip I made to Wyoming with a fellow Resident Advisor from the University of Utah. No, I am not that short. Jim was pushing me down, goofing. And, his hair is not yellow as the light must have hit his brown hair strangely in that pic. I talked this friend into "tripping" with me visit my ghost-town roots. We went out to the mines by Sheep Mountain where I used to live and my best friend's parents, the Frohbieters and one of the few folks still in Jeffrey City at that time. We, also visited Joe Hallock in Lander. 

Joe and his wife, Donna (Dune), studied with Mom and Dad before they got baptized in Billings, MT (district convention) when I was in about the 6th grade. Joe and Donna had actually donated the property that the Kingdom Hall and parking lot were built upon, so they lived right next to it. 

I enjoyed these people and all the time we spent with them at conventions. We spent a lot of time with Joe and Dune, usually eating and visiting when we travelled 60 miles from JC to Lander for Sunday meetings. Lots of laughing went with these visits, since the 2 of them were such jokesters, especially Dune!

I think we had maybe every other Sunday meeting in our trailer living room with my tall skinny dresser as the podium. Mom and Dad also conducted Bible studies with some folks that also ended up getting baptized later. Me? Yep! I conducted a Bible study with a fellow student when I was in the 5th grade using the pink Great Teacher Book. Last I knew that friend was a minister in another religion. I moved away in the 7th grade, though, and I guess she had a lot of teenage struggles in high school before pulling things together in pursuit of a relationship with God. She was a good friend.

Last I heard from someone else that Joe had some struggles, which I think he must have been going through when I visited. I am pretty sure Dune was not there at the time. What I heard was that he "fell-away" and Dune ended up with Alzheimers and ended up in a nursing home. He had 2 sons about 5 and 7 years older than me, both getting married about the same time as 18 and 20 year-olds right before we moved to Colorado. One of the son's wives, a rather large masculine young woman, later divulged that she was lesbian. I guess that turned Joe upside-down with disbelief as to how this could happen in the truth. I do believe he recovered his faith, but he was still plagued with what life threw upon Dune. I know less about how things turned out for the one son, though.

I know of many such stories, including my parents. My parents I think mostly struggled with how to get my middle two brothers raised, mostly the first one who affected the second one. Mom and Dad just quit attending meetings during the school year following that 1979 district convention. The congregation we attended had its issues (many of them my shirt-tail relatives), and at some point several years later was disbanded/closed. The first brother, who did not like attending JW meetings was in 7th grade at that point, and he was getting big into sports, which Dad thought would help him. We, also moved to 2 more new towns, and I finished high school in Utah.

Anyway, I did not attend another meeting until I moved back to Paonia right before college and lived by myself in our property there. I was dating one of the brothers (9 years older) that summer until shortly after I went to college in Salt Lake City. He asked me to marry him, but Dad did not like the idea, and he wanted me to stay in college. I have no regrets, but at the same time, I think I would have been just fine marrying. I definitely cared a lot about him, and we both loved the truth. I respected my parents wisdom, though, and I still do. They were not all wrong, just ahead of their time in foreseeing that highschool educations are not enough to support oneself nowadays.
