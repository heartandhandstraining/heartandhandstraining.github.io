This weekend we are covering the Sunday morning videos from the covention, I am greatly lookin forward to listening to the MP3's versions on my phone.

[PROGRAM](https://www.jw.org/finder?wtlocale=E&pub=co-pgm20&srcid=share) and [Downloadable](https://www.jw.org/en/library/videos/#en/categories/2020Convention) MP3-Audios and MP4-Videos

I believe I am on my way to putting much more of my Bible studying posts and pretty much only those on this site. I actually lost almost all my posts, except for a couple, due to moving things around on the github server, and I am not sure quite how I managed that. All is for the best, though, just one way to help me narrow down my time and interest where it should be, on Bible study and sharing it. It is making it easier to stick mostly to Bible-related work. As I previously stated my site building will incorporate web skills to present and share Bible information.
