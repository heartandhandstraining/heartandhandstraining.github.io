title: Jesus Regarding Other Faith
category: GOD

Because of my study via [Jesus-The Way](https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/jesus/), I want to write today.
As I was listening a couple of days ago and then again yesterday, and it actually made me feel better about my route in life. 

I never really lived what would appear to others as a non-Christian lifestyle. On the contrary, most seemed to think I looked and acted to0 much like a very conservative, submissive religious woman, like a JW. And, those fellow women I gravitated towards were similar, though not JW and no one religion. They were women of faith, trying to live according to God and with very high priority on caring for and raising our children with knowledge and respect for God. Most, if not all, were home-schooling Moms, except for me who was married to a public school science teacher (so that would not fly in our house, though I was of that mind to homeschool). We pretty much stuck to taking care of our homes and families, except for very occasional phone calls and meetups, more when the kids were small, to share and support each other a bit.

Anyway, my life in my time (from high-school till now for the most part) not directly, very actively participating with activities with JWs, I did associate with like-minded  non JWs. Those non-discriminatory against JWs might be few, but they do exist. This was where I developed a good habit of focusing on commonalities of having faith and Godly values and not on whether they were JW, "had the truth" or not. All these people in my past were of value as being good association, and certainly better than no association or association with non-worshipers of God. See [Mark 9:39-42](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/mark/9/#v41009039) This keeps us from stumbling others who have faith in God, whether JWs or not, and this is a serious offense in God's eyes. See [Matthew 18:10,14](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/matthew/18/#v40018010).

Besides all this, others of other religions are more likely to show interest in Jehovah Witnesses if JWs accept others as they are, where they are at in their faith.

This chapter, also, made me focus more on the positives of my life and faith. I never lost faith. I prayed, to some degree more when I was asking for help for myself or someone else. Though not enough, I was thankful and thanked God many times for seeming to place an angel over me, keeping me out of trouble, which often seemed to be all around, especially in college. I prayed for his Kingdome to come sooner than later, but not as often as I should. I somehow became not good at passing on the love of the Bible and heart-felt prayer on to my kids anywhere near as well as I should have. I lobbed out carelessly some likely defective seed (God's love and word), definitely hoping for the seed to grow somehow despite little attendance on my part. See [1Corinthians 3:6](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1-corinthians/3/#v46003006).

But, I did have some strength to endure through my association, faith, and prayer, which I never let go of and which enable me to get through some very rough times, especially in recent years (though likely not apparent very apparent to any outsider, whether JW or not). That I will save for later talk.
