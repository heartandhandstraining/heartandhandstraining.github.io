title: Teaching Someone to Love
category: GOD
---

In teaching others, we will run into people who seem not to be able to love or choose not to love, sometimes hard to tell which it is, and of course, no-one but Jehovah and Jesus can really know for sure. We can pretty much assume that almost all people are naturally physically [hard-wired for love](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2020-05-hard-wired.html). For some, no apparent capacity for love may be due to nuture. I will focus on these who seem unable to love due to life circumstances, the ability being forgotten or buried or just having not been loved in life. 

Teaching and love with a clean heart are intertwined. To be a good teacher, you have to have special interest in and love what you teach. I have experienced this, so though this task of teaching people, or helping them find, love/God cannot be an easy one, I know I can give it a good shot. I am going to tie the following information I have gathered together, hopefully tomorrow. In the meantime, if anyone sees this, they may want to study it, add or take away from it, and put something together for themselves about this topic.

[The Art of Love/Teaching Like Jesus](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20090715/Imitate-Jesus-Teach-With-Love/) and [The Science of Love](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140206155244.htm)

[James 3: 1](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/james/3/#v59003001): Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.

cleanse and guard your heart ....

[1 Timothy 1](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1-timothy/1/#v54001005-v54001007):Really, the objective of this instruction is love out of a clean heart and out of a good conscience and out of faith without hypocrisy. By deviating from these things, some have been turned aside to meaningless talk. They want to be teachers of law, but they do not understand either the things they are saying or the things they insist on so strongly.

[Deuteronomy 30:6](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/deuteronomy/30/#v5030006) Jehovah your God will cleanse your heart and the heart of your offspring, so that you will love Jehovah your God with all your heart and all your soul and you may live.

[1 Timothy 6:20,21](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1-timothy/6/#v54006020-v54006021): Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you,a turning away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from the contradictions of the falsely called “knowledge.” By making a show of such knowledge, some have deviated from the faith.

[Deuteronomy 10:15-19](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/deuteronomy/10/#v5010018https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/deuteronomy/10/#v5010016-v5010019): But only to your forefathers did Jehovah draw close and express his love, and he has chosen you, their offspring, out of all the peoples, as you are today. You must now cleanse your hearts and stop being so stubborn. For Jehovah your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the God great, mighty, and awe-inspiring, who treats none with partiality and does not accept a bribe. He executes justice for the fatherless child and the widow and loves the foreign resident,d giving him food and clothing. You too must love the foreign resident, for you became foreign residents in the land of Egypt.

[Deuteronomy 10:16](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/deuteronomy/10/#v5010016) You must now cleanse* your heartsy and stop being so stubborn.

Regarding [stubborness](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200004251): The basic meaning of the various original-language words that convey the idea of stubbornness is hardness or strength, especially in a bad sense. Often a deliberate refusal to comply with God’s will or commands is involved. 

[James 1:27](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/james/1/#v59001027) The form of worship that is clean and undefiled from the standpoint of our God and Father is this: to look after orphans and widows in their tribulation, and to keep oneself without spot from the world.

[1 John 4:8](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/1-john/4/#v62004008): For those who do not love have not come to know because God is love.

[Proverbs 28:14](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/proverbs/28/#v20028014): Happy is the man who is always on guard, But whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity.

[Proverbs 4:23](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/proverbs/4/#v20004023): Above all the things that you guard, safeguard your heart,For out of it are the sources of life.

[Romans 13:8](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/romans/13/#v45013008): Do not owe anything to anyone except to love one another; for whoever loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law.

[Galatians 5:6](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/galatians/5/#v48005006): For in union with Christ Jesus, neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any value, but faith operating through love is.
