title: Convince People of Other Faiths

Since I have so many of these sorts in my family and friend base, I have long felt like the one of the hardest challenge for Jehovah's Witnesses is that of convincing those already having strong faith in God (Jehovah) and Jesus but belonging to another religion. Another group would be those folks that seem minimal concept of love, but I will save that challenge thought for later. Jehovah's Witnesses are the Organization that Jehovah is working through. Showing this would seem to require a some time of exposure to exemplary examples of Jehovah's Witnesses and how they stand out as being far different, for the better, from other religions. The things that I believe should help in distinguishing Jehovah's Witnesses in this era as apart from other religions are:

1. Very orderly, specific, Bible-based, divinely-directed organizational structure with vast sharing of duties, responsibilities, and leadership producing smooth operations of this unified worldwide Organization

    - They are able to rapidly evolve with sudden changes in society as a whole and to changing needs of its members
    As always since their official beginnings, they have stayed on the cutting edge of technology, usually amongst the first to make use of it to fulfill [*command*](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/matthew/28/#v40028019) and [*prophecy*](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/matthew/24/#v40024014) of teaching the "good news" in all the inhabited earth.

    - I believe this is recognizable just taking in the extent of [*JW.ORG*](https://www.jw.org/), but that along with enough time spent participating in various meetings, service activities, assemblies,etc will give great clues to the depth and breadth of the organization, the many, many cogs/people (every single active JW around the world) playing their role, growing steadily and running so smoothly with sooooo many people worldwide cooperating together... What organization does that or has ever done that?

2. The [*abundance*](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/daniel/12/#v27012004) of [*readily available*](https://www.jw.org/) true knowledge shared freely with anyone and everyone [*around the world*](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/isaiah/11/#v23011009)

3. Monotheism of Jehovah's Witnesses vs. Babylonish polytheism, to which Jehovah has several times in history put an end to and will soon again do once and for all! With these accounts, Jehovah rescued the few who were righteous in his eyes, and the [*same applies*](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/matthew/7/#v40007013-v40007014) to His final "clean-up" of earth's people. To me this distinction takes a backseat to the first two, but the following can helpful in shedding light on this distinction.

    * [Supposedly 3 basically monotheistic religions](https://www.facinghistory.org/holocaust-and-human-behavior/chapter-1/religion-and-identity)

        - Christianity (non-JW) is primarily [Trinitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nontrinitarianism) (See all of the Polytheism links below.)

        - Judaism [has never accepted...the fulfillments of prophecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism%27s_view_of_Jesus) that Christianity attributes to Jesus.

        - Islam uses the Bible [to fill in the gaps of their own scriptural traditions](https://bibleinterp.arizona.edu/articles/muslims-and-bible-biblicists-and-islam)

    * [Polytheism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/polytheism) encompasses most Religions of the World.

        - [*Triple Deities Origin*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_deity)

        - [*History of the Trinity*](https://www.trinityhistory.com/chapters/chapter-1-the-history-of-the-trinity)

4. The entire Bible tells a complete and logical story of how everlasting life in paradise was lost with prophecies of the resulting trials and miseries, most of which have been fulfilled with the remaining prophecies to be fulfilled, including Jehovah taking over rulership of His Government over the restored paradise earth and the chosen sheep brought to perfection during Jesus 1000 year reign.

The above are the things that I believe should be of most use to open eyes of those who seem satisfied in their mainstream religions and their life because of that. Though these people may and do seem to exist, no doubt this is likely a fleeting thing. Most all people, also, can in some way relate to [*signs of the last days*](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/matthew/24/#v40024003-v40024014) and man's attitudes in our current [*critical times hard to deal with*](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/2-timothy/3/#v55003001-v55003007) and as a result see the need for the relief and hope that God's Word provides.
