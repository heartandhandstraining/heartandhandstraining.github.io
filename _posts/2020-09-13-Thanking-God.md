i definitely owe thanks for all and everything I everything I have, especially forgiveness, to Jehovah God through Jesus. This weeks' watchtower study. I missed the Zoom meeting, mostly in losing track of date and time with relatives here, as i do jave an internet connection here since were unable to . I have have hitting on many of the points in my discussions on- and off-line.

I love being able to listen to it in addition to reading it. I fell asleep listening last night and listeded again this morning when I awoke. 

I need to review the associated scriptures, especially the referenced prophecies. This is important for solidifying my knowledge as well as being abel to discuss it with others.
