I definitely more than owe thanks for all and everything I have, especially forgiveness, to Jehovah God through Jesus. This weeks' [watchtower study](https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/watchtower-study-july-2020/): Being Convinced You Have the Truth. I missed the Zoom meeting, mostly in losing track of date and time with relatives here. I do have an internet connection since we were unable to camp due to heavy smoke and fire danger. I have already so recently been hitting on many of the points in my discussions on- and off-line. Knowing these because of my age and experience, as well as reading about and listening to it, makes this knowledge even more meaningful and solidifying.

I love being able to listen to it in addition to reading it. I fell asleep listening last night and listeded again this morning when I awoke. 

I need to review the associated scriptures, especially the referenced prophecies. This is important for solidifying my knowledge as well as being abel to discuss it with others.
